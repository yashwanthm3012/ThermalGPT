first developed byJoseph Fourierin 1822 for the purpose of modeling how a quantity such asheatdiffuses through a given region Since then the heat equation and its variants have been found to be fundamental in many parts of both pure and applied mathematics Given an open subsetUofRnand a subintervalIofR one says that a functionuUIRis a solution of theheat equationif wherex1 xntdenotes a general point of the domain It is typical to refer totas time andx1 xnas spatial variables even in abstract contexts where these phrases fail to have their intuitive meaning The collection of spatial variables is often referred to simply asx For any given value oft the righthand side of the equation is theLaplacianof the functionut UR As such the heat equation is often written more compactly as utudisplaystyle frac partial upartial tDelta u In physics and engineering contexts especially in the context of diffusion through a medium it is more common to fix aCartesian coordinate systemand then to consider the specific case of afunctionuxyztof three spatial variablesxyzandtimevariablet One then says thatuis a solution of the heat equation if in whichis a positivecoefficientcalled thethermal diffusivityof the medium In addition to other physical phenomena this equation describes the flow of heat in a homogeneous and isotropic medium withuxyztbeing the temperature at the pointxyzand timet If the medium is not homogeneous and isotropic thenwould not be a fixed coefficient and would instead depend onxyz the equation would also have a slightly different form In the physics and engineering literature it is common to use2to denote the Laplacian rather than In mathematics as well as in physics and engineering it is common to useNewtons notationfor time derivatives so thatudisplaystyle dot uis used to denoteut so the equation can be written uudisplaystyle dot uDelta u Note also that the ability to use eitheror2to denote the Laplacian without explicit reference to the spatial variables is a reflection of the fact that the Laplacian is independent of the choice of coordinate system In mathematical terms one would say that the Laplacian is translationally and rotationally invariant In fact it is loosely speaking the simplest differential operator which has these symmetries This can be taken as a significant and purely mathematical justification of the use of the Laplacian and of the heat equation in modeling any physical phenomena which are homogeneous and isotropic of which heat diffusion is a principal example Thediffusivity constant is often not present in mathematical studies of the heat equation while its value can be very important in engineering This is not a major difference for the following reason Letube a function with Define a new functionvtxutxdisplaystyle vtxutalpha x Then according to thechain rule one has Thus there is a straightforward way of translating between solutions of the heat equation with a general value ofand solutions of the heat equation with 1 As such for the sake of mathematical analysis it is often sufficient to only consider the case 1 Since0displaystyle alpha 0there is another option to define avdisplaystyle vsatisfyingtvvtextstyle frac partial partial tvDelta vas in  above by settingvtxut12xdisplaystyle vtxutalpha 12x Note that the two possible means of defining the new functionvdisplaystyle vdiscussed here amount in physical terms to changing the unit of measure of time or the unit of measure of length The steadystate heat equation is by definition not dependent on time In other words it is assumed conditions exist such that This condition depends on the time constant and the amount of time passed since boundary conditions have been imposed Thus the condition is fulfilled in situations in which thetime equilibrium constant is fast enoughthat the more complex timedependent heat equation can be approximated by the steadystate case Equivalently the steadystate condition exists for all cases in whichenough time has passedthat the thermal fielduno longer evolves in time In the steadystate case a spatial thermal gradient may or may not exist but if it does it does not change in time This equation therefore describes the end result in all thermal problems in which a source is switched on for example an engine started in an automobile and enough time has passed for all permanent temperature gradients to establish themselves in space after which these spatial gradients no longer change in time as again with an automobile in which the engine has been running for long enough The other trivial solution is for all spatial temperature gradients to disappear as well in which case the temperature become uniform in space as well The equation is much simpler and can help to understand better the physics of the materials without focusing on the dynamic of the heat transport process It is widely used for simple engineering problems assuming there is equilibrium of the temperature fields and heat transport with time Steadystate condition The steadystate heat equation for a volume that contains a heat source the inhomogeneous case is thePoissons equation whereuis thetemperaturekis thethermal conductivityandqis the rate of heat generation per unit volume Inelectrostatics this is equivalent to the case where the space under consideration contains an electrical charge The steadystate heat equation without a heat source within the volume the homogeneous case is the equation in electrostatics for a volume of free space that does not contain a charge It is described byLaplaces equation Informally the Laplacian operatorgives the difference between the average value of a function in the neighborhood of a point and its value at that point Thus ifuis the temperatureuconveys if and by how much the material surrounding each point is hotter or colder on the average than the material at that point By thesecond law of thermodynamics heat will flow from hotter bodies to adjacent colder bodies in proportion to the difference of temperature and of thethermal conductivityof the material between them When heat flows into respectively out of a material its temperature increases respectively decreases in proportion to the amount of heat divided by the amount mass of material with aproportionality factorcalled thespecific heat capacityof the material By the combination of these observations the heat equation says the rateudisplaystyle dot uat which the material at a point will heat up or cool down is proportional to how much hotter or cooler the surrounding material is The coefficientin the equation takes into account the thermal conductivity specific heat anddensityof the material The first half of the above physical thinking can be put into a mathematical form The key is that for any fixedx one has whereuxris the singlevariable function denoting theaverage valueofuover the surface of the sphere of radiusrcentered atx it can be defined by in whichn 1denotes the surface area of the unit ball inndimensional Euclidean space This formalizes the above statement that the value ofuat a pointxmeasures the difference between the value ofuxand the value ofuat points nearby tox in the sense that the latter is encoded by the values ofuxrfor small positive values ofr Following this observation one may interpret the heat equation as imposing aninfinitesimal averagingof a function Given a solution of the heat equation the value ofuxt for a small positive value ofmay be approximated as12ntimes the average value of the functionutover a sphere of very small radius centered atx The heat equation implies that peaks local maxima ofudisplaystyle uwill be gradually eroded down while depressions local minima will be filled in The value at some point will remain stable only as long as it is equal to the average value in its immediate surroundings In particular if the values in a neighborhood are very close to a linear functionAxByCzDdisplaystyle AxByCzD then the value at the center of that neighborhood will not be changing at that time that is the derivativeudisplaystyle dot uwill be zero A more subtle consequence is themaximum principle that says that the maximum value ofudisplaystyle uin any regionRdisplaystyle Rof the medium will not exceed the maximum value that previously occurred inRdisplaystyle R unless it is on the boundary ofRdisplaystyle R That is the maximum temperature in a regionRdisplaystyle Rcan increase only if heat comes in from outsideRdisplaystyle R This is a property ofparabolic partial differential equationsand is not difficult to prove mathematically see below Another interesting property is that even ifudisplaystyle uinitially has a sharp jump discontinuity of value across some surface inside the medium the jump is immediately smoothed out by a momentary infinitesimally short but infinitely large rate of flow of heat through that surface For example if two isolated bodies initially at uniform but different temperaturesu0displaystyle u0andu1displaystyle u1 are made to touch each other the temperature at the point of contact will immediately assume some intermediate value and a zone will develop around that point whereudisplaystyle uwill gradually vary betweenu0displaystyle u0andu1displaystyle u1 If a certain amount of heat is suddenly applied to a point in the medium it will spread out in all directions in the form of adiffusion wave Unlike theelasticandelectromagnetic waves the speed of a diffusion wave drops with time as it spreads over a larger region the temperature gradient decreases and therefore the heat flow decreases too For heat flow the heat equation follows from the physical laws ofconduction of heatandconservation of energyCannon 1984

on several principles Heat flow is a form ofenergyflow and as such it is meaningful to speak of the time rate of flow of heat into a region of space Putting these equations together gives the general equation of heat flow Remarks In the special cases of propagation of heat in anisotropicandhomogeneousmedium in a 3dimensionalspace this equation is where The heat equation is a consequence of Fouriers law of conduction seeheat conduction If the medium is not the whole space in order to solve the heat equation uniquely we also need to specifyboundary conditionsforu To determine uniqueness of solutions in the whole space it is necessary to assume additional conditions for example an exponential bound on the growth of solutions1or a sign condition nonnegative solutions are unique by a result ofDavid Widder2 Solutions of the heat equation are characterized by a gradual smoothing of the initial temperature distribution by the flow ofheatfrom warmer to colder areas of an object Generally many different states and starting conditions will tend toward the same stableequilibrium As a consequence to reverse the solution and conclude something about earlier times or initial conditions from the present heat distribution is very inaccurate except over the shortest of time periods The heat equation is the prototypical example of aparabolic partial differential equation Using theLaplace operator the heat equation can be simplified and generalized to similar equations over spaces of arbitrary number of dimensions as where the Laplace operator  or 2 the divergence of the gradient is taken in the spatial variables The heat equation governs heat diffusion as well as other diffusive processes such asparticle diffusionor the propagation ofaction potentialin nerve cells Although they are not diffusive in nature some quantum mechanics problems are also governed by a mathematical analog of the heat equation see below It also can be used to model some phenomena arising infinance like theBlackScholesor theOrnsteinUhlenbeck processes The equation and various nonlinear analogues has also been used in image analysis The heat equation is technically in violation ofspecial relativity because its solutions involve instantaneous propagation of a disturbance The part of the disturbance outside the forwardlight conecan usually be safely neglected but if it is necessary to develop a reasonable speed for the transmission of heat ahyperbolic problemshould be considered instead  like a partial differential equation involving a secondorder time derivative Some models of nonlinear heat conduction which are also parabolic equations have solutions with finite heat transmission speed34 The functionuabove represents temperature of a body Alternatively it is sometimes convenient to change units and representuas the heat density of a medium Since heat density is proportional to temperature in a homogeneous medium the heat equation is still obeyed in the new units Suppose that a body obeys the heat equation and in addition generates its own heat per unit volume eg in wattslitre  WL at a rate given by a known functionqvarying in space and time5Then the heat per unit volumeusatisfies an equation For example a tungsten light bulb filament generates heat so it would have a positive nonzero value forqwhen turned on While the light is turned off the value ofqfor the tungsten filament would be zero The following solution technique for the heat equation was proposed byJoseph Fourierin his treatiseThéorie analytique de la chaleur published in 1822 Consider the heat equation for one space variable This could be used to model heat conduction in a rod The equation is whereuuxt is a function of two variablesxandt Here We assume the initial

propertyuis a product in which the dependence ofuonxtis separated that is This solution technique is calledseparation of variables Substitutinguback into equation 1 Since the right hand side depends only onxand the left hand side only ont both sides are equal to some constant value  Thus and We will now show that nontrivial solutions for 6 for values of 0 cannot occur This solves the heat equation in the special case that the dependence ofuhas the special form 4 In general the sum of solutions to 1 that satisfy the boundary conditions 3 also satisfies 1 and 3 We can show that the solution to 1 2 and 3 is given by where The solution technique used above can be greatly extended to many other types of equations The idea is that the operatoruxxwith the zero boundary conditions can

prototypicalparabolic partial differential equation the heat equation is among the most widely studied topics inpure mathematics and its analysis is regarded as fundamental to the broader field ofpartial differential equations The heat equation can also be considered onRiemannian manifolds leading to many geometric applications Following work ofSubbaramiah MinakshisundaramandÅke Pleijel the heat equation is closely related withspectral geometry A seminalnonlinear variant of the heat equationwas introduced todifferential geometrybyJames EellsandJoseph Sampsonin 1964 inspiring the

httpstutorialmathlamareduclassesdetheheatequationaspx,Differential Equations  The Heat Equation,In this section we will do a partial derivation of the heat equation that can be solved to give the temperature in a one dimensional bar of length L In addition we give several possible boundary conditions that can be used in this situation We also define the Laplacian in this section and give a version of the heat equation for two or three dimensional situations,Before we get into actually solving partial differential equations and before we even start discussing the method of separation of variables we want to spend a little bit of time talking about the two main partial differential equations that well be solving later on in the chapter Well look at the first one in this section and the second one in the next section The first partial differential equation that well be looking at once we get started with solving will be the heat equation which governs the temperature distribution in an object We are going to give several forms of the heat equation for reference purposes but we will only be really solving one of them We will start out by considering the temperature in a 1D bar of length L What this means is that we are going to assume that the bar starts off at x  0 and ends when we reach x  L We are also going to so assume that at any location x the temperature will be constant at every point in the cross section at that x In other words temperature will only vary in x and we can hence consider the bar to be a 1D bar Note that with this assumption the actual shape of the cross section iecircular rectangularetc doesnt matter Note that the 1D assumption is actually not all that bad of an assumption as it might seem at first glance If we assume that the lateral surface of the bar is perfectly insulated ieno heat can flow through the lateral surface then the only way heat can enter or leave the bar as at either end This means that heat can only flow from left to right or right to left and thus creating a 1D temperature distribution The assumption of the lateral surfaces being perfectly insulated is of course impossible but it is possible to put enough insulation on the lateral surfaces that there will be very little heat flow through them and so at least for a time we can consider the lateral surfaces to be perfectly insulated Okay lets now get some definitions out of the way before we write down the first form of the heat equation We should probably make a couple of comments about some of these quantities before proceeding The specific heat cleft x right  0 of a material is the amount of heat energy that it takes to raise one unit of mass of the material by one unit of temperature As indicated we are going to assume at least initially that the specific heat may not be uniform throughout the bar Note as well that in practice the specific heat depends upon the temperature However this will generally only be an issue for large temperature differences which in turn depends on the material the bar is made out of and so were going to assume for the purposes of this discussion that the temperature differences are not large enough to affect our solution The mass density rho left x right is the mass per unit volume of the material As with the specific heat were going to initially assume that the mass density may not be uniform throughout the bar The heat flux varphi left xt right is the amount of thermal energy that flows to the right per unit surface area per unit time The flows to the right bit simply tells us that if varphi left xt right  0 for some x and t then the heat is flowing to the right at that point and time Likewise if varphi left xt right  0 then heat energy is being added to the system at that location and time and if Qleft xt right  0 is thethermal conductivityof the material and measures the ability of a given material to conduct heat The better a material can conduct heat the larger K0left x right will be As noted the thermal conductivity can vary with the location in the bar Also much like the specific heat the thermal conductivity can vary with temperature but we will assume that the total temperature change is not so great that this will be an issue and so we will assume for the purposes here that the thermal conductivity will not vary with temperature Fouriers law does a very good job of modeling what we know to be true about heat flow First we know that if the temperature in a region is constantiefracpartial upartial x  0 then there is no heat flow Next we know that if there is a temperature difference in a region we know the heat will flow from the hot portion to the cold portion of the region For example if it is hotter to the right then we know that the heat should flow to the left When it is hotter to the right then we also know that fracpartial upartial x  0 iethe temperature increases as we move to the right and so well have varphi  0 and heat will flow to the right as it should Finally the greater the temperature difference in a region iethe larger fracpartial upartial x is then the greater the heat flow So if we plug Fouriers law into eqrefeqeq1 we get the following form of the heat equation Note that we factored the minus sign out of the derivative to cancel against the minus sign that was already there We cannot however factor the thermal conductivity out of the derivative since it is a function of x and the derivative is with respect to x Solving eqrefeqeq2 is quite difficult due to the non uniform nature of the thermal properties and the mass density So lets now assume that these properties are all constantie where c rho  and K0 are now all fixed quantities In this case we generally say that the material in the bar isuniform Under these assumptions the heat equation becomes For a final simplification to the heat equation lets divide both sides by crho  and define thethermal diffusivityto be The heat equation is then To most people this is what they mean when they talk about the heat equation and in fact it will be the equation that well be solving Well actually well be solving eqrefeqeq4 with no external sourcesieQleft xt right  0 but well be considering this form when we start discussing separation of variables in a couple of sections Well only drop the sources term when we actually start solving the heat equation Now that weve got the 1D heat equation taken care of we need to move into the initial and boundary conditions well also need in order to solve the problem If you go back to any of our solutions of ordinary differential equations that weve done in previous sections you can see that the number of conditions required always matched the highest order of the derivative in the equation In partial differential equations the same idea holds except now we have to pay attention to the variable were differentiating with respect to as well So for the heat equation weve got a first order time derivative and so well need one initial condition and a second order spatial derivative and so well need two boundary conditions The initial condition that well use here is and we dont really need to say much about it here other than to note that this just tells us what the initial temperature distribution in the bar is The boundary conditions will tell us something about what the temperature andor heat flow is doing at the boundaries of the bar There are four of them that are fairly common boundary conditions The first type of boundary conditions that we can have would be theprescribed temperatureboundary conditions also calledDirichlet conditions The prescribed temperature boundary conditions are The next type of boundary conditions areprescribed heat flux also calledNeumann conditions Using Fouriers law these can be written as If either of the boundaries areperfectly insulatediethere is no heat flow out of them then these boundary conditions reduce to and note that we will often just call these particular boundary conditionsinsulatedboundaries and drop the perfectly part The third type of boundary conditions useNewtons law of coolingand are sometimes calledRobins conditions These are usually used when the bar is in a moving fluid and note we can consider air to be a fluid for this purpose Here are the equations for this kind of boundary condition where H is a positive quantity that is experimentally determined and g1left t right and g2left t right give the temperature of the surrounding fluid at the respective boundaries Note that the two conditions do vary slightly depending on which boundary we are at At x  0 we have a minus sign on the right side while we dont at x  L To see why this is lets first assume that at x  0 we have uleft 0t right  g1left t right In other words the bar is hotter than the surrounding fluid and so at x  0 the heat flow as given by the left side of the equation must be to the left or negative since the heat will flow from the hotter bar into the cooler surrounding liquid If the heat flow is negative then we need to have a minus sign on the right side of the equation to make sure that it has the proper sign If the bar is cooler than the surrounding fluid at x  0ieuleft 0t right  g2left t right In this case the heat flow must be to the right or be positive and so in this case we cant have a minus sign Finally well again leave it to you to verify that we cant have the minus sign at x  L is the bar is cooler than the surrounding fluid as well Note that we are not actually going to be looking at any of these kinds of boundary conditions here These types of boundary conditions tend to lead to boundary value problems such asExample 5in the Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions section of the previous chapter As we saw in that example it is often very difficult to get our hands on the eigenvalues and as well eventually see we will need them It is important to note at this point that we can also mix and match these boundary conditions so to speak There is nothing wrong with having a prescribed temperature at one boundary and a prescribed flux at the other boundary for example so dont always expect the same boundary condition to show up at both ends This warning is more important that it might seem at this point because once we get into solving the heat equation we are going to have the same kind of condition on each end to simplify the problem somewhat The final type of boundary conditions that well need here areperiodicboundary conditions Periodic boundary conditions are Note that for these kinds of boundary conditions the left boundary tends to be x   L instead of x  0 as we were using in the previous types of boundary conditions The periodic boundary conditions will arise very naturally from a couple of particular geometries that well be looking at down the road We will now close out this section with a quick look at the 2D and 3D version of the heat equation However before we jump into that we need to introduce a little bit of notation first Thedeloperator is defined to be depending on whether we are in 2 or 3 dimensions Think of the del operator as a function that takes functions as arguments instead of numbers as were used to Whatever function we plug into the operator gets put into the partial derivatives So for example in 3D we would have This of course is also the gradient of the function fleft xyz right The del operator also allows us to quickly write down the divergence of a function So again using 3D as an example the divergence of fleft xyz right can be written as the dot product of the del operator and the function Or Finally we will also see the following show up in our work This is usually denoted as and is called theLaplacian The 2D version of course simply doesnt have the third term Okay we can now look into the 2D and 3D version of the heat equation and where ever the del operator and or Laplacian appears assume that it is the appropriate dimensional version The higher dimensional version of eqrefeqeq1 is and note that the specific heat c and mass density rho  are may not be uniform and so may be functions of the spatial variables Likewise the external sources term Q may also be a function of both the spatial variables and time Next the higher dimensional version of Fouriers law is where the thermal conductivity K0 is again assumed to be a function of the spatial variables If we plug this into eqrefeqeq5 we get the heat equation for a non uniform bar iethe thermal properties may be functions of the spatial variables with external sourcessinks If we now assume that the specific heat mass density and thermal conductivity are constant iethe bar is uniform the heat equation becomes where we divided both sides by crho  to get the thermal diffusivity k in front of the Laplacian The initial condition for the 2D or 3D heat equation is depending upon the dimension were in The prescribed temperature boundary condition becomes where left xy right or left xyz right depending upon the dimension were in will range over the portion of the boundary in which we are prescribing the temperature The prescribed heat flux condition becomes where the left side is only being evaluated at points along the boundary and vec n is the outward unit normal on the surface Newtons law of cooling will become where H is a positive quantity that is experimentally determine uB is the temperature of the fluid at the boundary and again it is assumed that this is only being evaluated at points along the boundary We dont have periodic boundary conditions here as they will only arise from specific 1D geometries We should probably also acknowledge at this point that well not actually be

study of partial differential equations with the problem of heat flow in a uniform bar of length L situated on the x axis with one end at the origin and the other at x  L Figure 1211  We assume that the bar is perfectly insulated except possibly at its endpoints and that the temperature is constant on each cross section and therefore depends only on x and t We also assume that the thermal properties of the bar are independent of x and t In this case it can be shown that the temperature u  ux t at time t at a point x units from the origin satisfies the partial differential equation uta2uxxquad 00nonumber  where a is a positive constant determined by the thermal properties This is theheat equation To determine u we must specify the temperature at every point in the bar when t0 say ux0fxquad 0le xle L nonumber  We call this theinitialcondition We must also specifyboundary conditionsthat u must satisfy at the ends of the bar for all t0 Well call this problem aninitialboundary value problem We begin with the boundary conditions u0tuLt0 and write the initialboundary value problem as labeleq1211 beginarraycuta2uxxquad 004ptu0t0quad uLt0quad t04ptux0fxquad 0leq xleq Lendarray  Our method of solving this problem is calledseparation of variablesnot to be confused with method of separation of variables used in Section 22 for solving ordinary differential equations We begin by looking for functions of the form vxtXxTt nonumber  that are not identically zero and satisfy vta2vxxquad v0t0quad vLt0 nonumber  for all xt Since vtXT quad textand quad vxxXT nonumber  vta2vxx if and only if XTa2XT nonumber  which we rewrite as Tover a2TXover X nonumber  Since the expression on the left is independent of x while the one on the right is independent of t this equation can hold for all xt only if the two sides equal the same constant which we call aseparation constant and write it as lambda thus Xover XTover a2Tlambda nonumber  This is equivalent to Xlambda X0 nonumber  and labeleq1212 Ta2lambda T  Since v0tX0Tt0 and vLtXLTt0 and we dont want T to be identically zero X00 and XL0 Therefore lambda must be an eigenvalue of the boundary value problem labeleq1213 Xlambda X0quad X00quad XL0  and X must be a lambdaeigenfunction From Theorem 1112 the eigenvalues of Equation refeq1213 are lambdann2pi2L2 with associated eigenfunctions Xnsinnpi xover L quad n123dots nonumber  Substituting lambdan2pi2L2 into Equation refeq1212 yields Tn2pi2a2L2T nonumber  which has the solution Tnen2pi2a2tL2 nonumber  Now let vnxtXnxTnten2pi2a2tL2sinnpi xover Lquad n123dots nonumber  Since vnx0sinnpi xover L nonumber  vn satisfies Equation refeq1211 with fxsin npi xL More generally if alpha1dotsalpham are constants and umxt sumn1m alphanen2pi2a2tL2sinnpi xover L nonumber  then um satisfies Equation refeq1211 with fxsumn1m alphansinnpi xover L nonumber  This motivates the next definition Theformal solutionof the initialboundary value problem labeleq1214 beginarraycuta2uxxquad 004ptu0t0quad uLt0quad t04ptux0fxquad 0leq xleq Lendarray  is labeleq1215 uxtsumn1infty alphanen2pi2a2tL2sinnpi xover L  where Sxsumn1infty alphansinnpi xover L nonumber  is the Fourier sine series of f on 0L that is alphan dfrac2L int0L fx sin dfracnpi xL dx nonumber  We use the term formal solution in this definition because it is not in general true that the infinite series in Equation refeq1215 actually satisfies all the requirements of the initialboundary value problem Equation refeq1214 when it does we say that it is anactual solutionof Equation refeq1214 Because of the negative exponentials in Equation refeq1215 u converges for all xt with t0 Since each term in Equation refeq1215 satisfies the heat equation and the boundary conditions in Equation refeq1214 u also has these properties if ut and uxx can be obtained by differentiating the series in Equation refeq1215 term by term once with respect to t and twice with respect to x for t0 However it is not always legitimate to differentiate an infinite series term by term The next theorem gives a useful sufficient condition for legitimacy of term by term differentiation of an infinite series We omit the proof A convergent infinite series Wzsumn1infty wnz nonumber  can be differentiated term by term on a closed interval z1z2 to obtain Wzsumn1infty wnz nonumber  where the derivatives at zz1 and zz2 are onesided provided that wn is continuous on z1z2 and wnzle Mnquad z1le zle z2quad n123dots nonumber  where M1 M2  Mn  are constants such that the series sumn1infty Mn converges Theorem 1212  applied twice with zx and once with zt shows that uxx and ut can be obtained by differentiating u term by term if t0 Exercise 12154 Therefore u satisfies the heat equation and the boundary conditions in Equation refeq1214 for t0 Therefore since ux0Sx for 0le xle L u is an actual solution of Equation refeq1214 if and only if Sxfx for 0le xle L From Theorem 1132 this is true if f is continuous and piecewise smooth on 0L and f0fL0 In this chapter well define formal solutions of several kinds of problems When we ask you to solve such problems we always mean that you should find a formal solution

can enhance your understanding of the solutions of initialboundary value problems To be specific consider the formal solution uxtsumn1infty alphanen2pi2a2tL2sinnpi xover Lnonumber  of Equation refeq1214 where Sxsumn1infty alphan sinnpi x over Lnonumber  is the Fourier sine series of f on 0L Consider the mth partial sum labeleq12112 umxtsumn1m alphanen2pi2a2tL2sinnpi xover L  For several fixed values of t including t0 graph umxt versus t In some cases it may be useful to graph the curves corresponding to the various values of t on the same axes in other cases you may want to graph the various curves successively for increasing values of t and create a primitive motion picture on your monitor Repeat this experiment for several values of m to compare how the results depend upon m for small and large values of t However keep in mind that the meanings of small and large in this case depend upon the constants a2 and L2 A good way to handle this is to rewrite Equation refeq12112 as umxtsumn1m alphanen2tausinnpi xover Lnonumber  where labeleq12113 taupi2a2tover L2  and graph um versus x for selected values of tau These comments also apply to the situations considered in

httpslevelupgitconnectedcomsolving2dheatequationnumericallyusingpython3334004aa01a,Solving 2D Heat Equation Numerically using Python  Level Up Coding,How to solve heat equation numerically using Python,Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in G Nervadof Follow Level Up Coding  14 Listen Share When I was in college studying physics a few years ago I remember there was a task to solve heat equation analytically for some simple problems In the next semester we learned about numerical methods to solve some partial differential equations PDEs in general Its really interesting to see how we could solve them numerically and visualize the solutions as a heat map and its really cool pun intended I also remember in the previous semester we learned C programming language so it was natural for us to solve PDEs numerically using C although some students were struggling with C and not with solving the PDE itself If I had known how to code in Python back then I wouldve used it instead of C I am not saying C is bad though Here I am going to show how we can solve 2D heat equation numerically and see how easy it is to translate the equations into Python code Before we do the Python code lets talk about the heat equation and finitedifference method Heat equation is basically a partial differential equation it is If we want to solve it in 2D Cartesian we can write the heat equation above like this whereuis the quantity that we want to knowtis for temporal variablexandyare for spatial variables andis diffusivity constant So basically we want to find the solutionueverywhere inxandy and over timet Now lets see the finitedifference method FDM in a nutshell Finitedifference method is a numerical method for solving differential equations by approximating derivative with finite differences Remember that the definition of derivative is In finitedifference method we approximate it and remove the limit So instead of using differential and limit symbol we use delta symbol which is the finite difference Note that this is oversimplified because we have to use Taylor series expansion and derive it from there by assuming some terms to be sufficiently small but we get the rough idea behind this method In finitedifference method we are going to discretize the spatial domain and the time intervalxy andt We can write it like this As we can seeij andkare the steps for each difference forxy andtrespectively What we want is the solutionu which is Note thatkis superscript to denote time step foru We can write the heat equation above using finitedifference method like this If we arrange the equation above by taking x y we get this final equation where We can use this stencil to remember the equation above look at subscriptsijfor spatial steps and superscriptkfor the time step We use explicit method to get the solution for the heat equation so it will be numerically stable whenever Everything is ready Now we can solve the original heat equation approximated by algebraic equation above which is computerfriendly For an exercise problem lets suppose a thin square plate with the side of 50 unit length The temperature everywhere inside the plate is originally 0 degree att 0 lets see the diagram below this is not realistic but its good for exercise For our model lets take x 1 and 20 Now we can use Python code to solve this problem numerically to see the temperature everywhere denoted byiandj and over time denoted byk Lets first import all of the necessary libraries and then set up the boundary and initial conditions Weve set up the initial and boundary conditions lets write the calculation function based on finitedifference method that weve derived above Lets prepare the plot function so we can visualize the solution for eachk as a heat map We useMatplotliblibrary its easy to use One more thing that we need is to animate the result because we want to see the temperature points inside the plate change over time So lets create the function to animate the solution Now were done Lets see the complete code below and run it Thats it And heres the result Cool isnt it By the way you can try the code above using this Python Online Compilerhttpsreplitlanguagespython3 make sure you change themaxitertimeto 50 before you run the code to make the iteration result faster Okay we have the code now lets play with something more interesting lets set all of the boundary conditions to 0 and then randomize the initial condition for the interior grid And heres the result Python is relatively easy to learn for beginners compared to other programming languages I would recommend to use Python for solving computational problems like weve done here at least for prototyping because it has really powerful numerical and scientific libraries The community is also growing bigger and bigger and that can make things easier to Google when were stuck with it Python may not be as fast as C or C but using Python we can focus more on the problem solving itself rather than the language of course we still need to know the Python syntax and its simple array manipulation to some degree but once we get it it will be really powerful

todays world numerous challenges exist particularly in computational science This post focuses on solving scientific problems through simulations such as computational physics These simulations are essential for advancing our understanding of complex systems and improving various technologies To understand the framework we first need a clear vision of Partial Differential Equations PDEs Then we will provide a brief overview of PhysicsInformed Neural Networks PINNs and their implementation Multivariable CalculusMultivariable calculus extends singlevariable calculus to functions with more than one variable It involves studying functions that depend on multiple variables and covers concepts such as partial derivatives Partial derivatives refer to taking the derivative of a function that depends on more than one variable with respect to one variable while keeping the other variables constant Partial derivatives play an important role in multivariable calculus and help us understand how functions change For a function fx y z  the partial derivative with respect to x is denoted as fracpartial fpartial x This represents the rate at which f changes as x changes while y z ldots remain constant There are several common notations for partial derivatives fx or fracpartial fpartial x for the partial derivative of  f  with respect to  x  A partial differential equation PDE is an equation that contains derivatives of an unknown function that depends on more than one independent variable PDEs are used to model a wide variety of phenomena in physics engineering economics and other sciences These equations play a critical role in describing processes such as heat transfer wave propagation fluid dynamics and quantum mechanics Fleftx1 x2 ldots xn u fracpartial upartial x1 fracpartial upartial x2 ldots fracpartial upartial xn fracpartial2 upartial x12 fracpartial2 upartial x1 partial x2 ldots right  0 where u  ux1 x2 ldots xn is the unknown function and F is a given function Heat EquationThe heat equation is a partial differential equation used to model heat diffusion processes It describes how heat propagates in a medium over time and is often applied to different geometries such as a rod plate or threedimensional object frepresents the residual of the governing partial differential equation PDE For the 2D heat equation this residual is given by f  ut  alpha uxx  uyy Ideally if the neural network perfectly satisfies the PDE the residualfshould be zero for all points in the domain Here urepresents the temperature distribution as a function of position x y and time tthe thermal diffusivity of the material alpha Solving partial differential equations PDEs presents several significant challenges By addressing these issues we can better understand the requirements for effective PDE solutions and the potential for innovative approaches like PhysicsInformed Neural Networks PINNs to overcome these challenges PhysicsInformed Neural Networks PINNs offer several advantages for solving partial differential equations PDEs Here are some key reasons why they are needed PhysicsInformed Neural Networks are a powerful tool especially for problems with data constraints and physical consistency requirements PINNs provide innovative and effective solutions to problems that are difficult or impossible to solve using traditional methods When building PINNs we adhere to neural network principles inputs hidden layers outputs activation functions loss functions etc One of the most important parts is adding a physical loss to the classical neural network loss system to learn with physical laws In this post we will implement theHeat Equationmentioned in the previous sections We will extend the loss function with theHeat Equationloss to minimize the residual of the problem and use traditional constraints like boundaries in our neural network design PINNs like other neural networks use gradientbased numerical optimization techniques to minimize the loss function such as backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent SGD After training the PhysicsInformed Neural Network PINN model we can observe the heat diffusion process over time This involves visualizing the temperature distribution across the medium showing how heat propagates through the systemModel Output Heat Diffusion Animation AI models offer a powerful method for solving complex partial differential equations PDEs by integrating physical laws into neural network training The PINN approach ensures physical consistency efficient computation and accurate generalization from limited data In this post we discussed the basics of PDEs the advantages of PINNs and demonstrated their implementation using the 2D heat equation The results highlighted PINNs ability to model heat diffusion accurately and efficiently As computational science advances AI models are set to become invaluable tools for researchers and engineers enabling the solution of previously intractable problems across various fields Copyright  2024 Mert Kavi

part about PINNs is that since there are so many parameters to tune you can get several papers out of the same problem Then these researchers get more publications hence better job prospects and go on

problems with the way the PDEcomponent of the loss function needs to be posed and outside of throwing tons of often Chinese PhD students and postdocs at it they usually dont work for actual problems Mostly owed to the instabilities of higher order automatic derivatives at which point PINNpeople begin to go through a cascade of alternative approaches to obtain these higherorder derivatives But

httpwwwincompleteideasnetIncIdeasBitterLessonhtmlI would love to hear HNs take on this argument I would love to hear HNs take on this argument reply See the reason for the Bitter Lesson being a lesson is that Neural Nets that Sutton is mainly writing about are pretty crap at representing background knowledge The only way you can store expert knowledge in a neural net is to modify its structure and its weights The weights you can only modify by some kind of learning procedure like backprop in practice Very limited forms of background knowledge like convolutions can be encoded in a neural nets structure but imagine trying to represent I dont know the last ten lines of code you wrote today as a bunch of neural net connections Continuous functions is just not the right kind of notation for that sort of thingIf neural nets were any better at encoding background knowledge they would use it but they cant so they have to rely on data And thats why they need so much of it Background knowledge functions as a strong inductive bias it directs the search for a hypothesis to hypotheses that we know make sense again think of convolutions Without background knowledge or with only a little background knowledge you need tons of examples to learn anything usefulSo the Bitter Lesson is basically making a virtue out of necessity In any case its not a prescriptive thing only

developing an appropriate algorithm which obviously has to also incorporate the physics which solves the problem and which can be analyzed mathematically reply reply It used to be almost everyone

not modified to reflect GWPs from AR5 As of 2024 the Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator uses the Emissions  Generation Resource Integrated Database eGRID which derives regional emission factors for electric power marginal and baseload emissions and enables users to map their residential or commercial zip code to their region This results in more accurate emissions estimates regarding their energy use relative to the previous national default and affects the electricity used and avoided factors The regionally specific and national weighted emission rates are presented in Table 1  Table 1

respectively These estimates are based on the following assumptions The estimates of carbon sequestered by coniferous and deciduous trees were then weighted by the percent share of coniferous versus deciduous trees in cities across the United States Of a sample of approximately 14000 coniferous and deciduous trees in seventeen major US cities approximately 11 percent and 89 percent of sampled trees were coniferous and deciduous respectively McPherson et al 2016 Therefore the weighted average annual carbon sequestered by a medium growth coniferous or deciduous tree planted in an urban setting and allowed to grow for 10 years is 364 lbs of carbon per tree Trees sequester significantly less carbon in early life than mid life and carbon sequestration slows in late life The typical age of each tree species is variable as is the rate of growth hence this method determines an annual average assuming ten years of growth Please note the following caveats to these assumptions To convert

equal to overall tree growth minus removals ie harvest for the production of paper and wood and tree loss from natural disturbances minus decomposition In most US forests growth exceeds removals and

the great potential of hydrogen in energy transformation and sustainable development around the world how to realize the adequate transportation of hydrogen has become a hot spot of concern1 Among them as a critical form of hydrogen transportation natural gas hydrogen mixing technology is developing rapidly Meanwhile as a new type of pipeline  hydropower gas etc  laying method is necessary for developing civilized cities the construction of underground pipe galleries is also in full swing The twos rapid growth and application overlap will inevitably lead to many hydrogendoped natural gas pipelines passing through the underground pipe gallery to deliver hydrogen to end users According to statistics largescale natural gas pipelines are currently laid in the underground pipe gallery It is worth noting that the change in the conveying medium will inevitably lead to a difference in the fluid dynamics performance of the leakage and diffusion behavior of the medium and further affect the response of the relevant safety control measures2345 Therefore exploring the leakage and diffusion characteristics of hydrogendoped natural gas pipelines in the underground pipe gallery can enhance the understanding of safety management and control and help to further promote the development of energy transformation and lowcarbon society Methane and hydrogen leakage diffusion and explosion in confined or semiconfined environments have been the subject of numerous investigations by domestic and international researchers When the hydrogen blending ratio was less than 50 the accumulation behavior of hydrogendoped natural gas was comparable to that of pure natural gas according to Lowesmiths6study on the leakage and accumulation behavior of hydrogendoped natural gas in confined areas Wilkening et al7simulated the diffusion and leakage of pure methane and H2CH4mixture gas in the pipeline under windy and windless conditions respectively and discovered that the mixed gass leakage rate and volume were greater than methanes The research of Li Du8and Li Ranran et al9 showed that the static storage of hydrogendoped natural gas after leakage in the kitchen would cause gas stratification and different gas components and leakage conditions had significant effects on the concentration distribution In order to examine the diffusion law and leakage of hydrogendoped natural gas in a valve chamber under various hydrogen volume concentrations wind speeds leakage diameters and leakage port directions Jia Wenlong et al10used a typical valve chamber from the WestEast Gas Pipeline as an example Stefano11and Mohammad et al12 studied how the diffusion of hydrogen in a confined space is significantly affected by the leak rate while the leak location is less affected and revealed the diffusion behavior of the gas and measured the danger height and vanishing moment Gupta et al13s research shows that the peak concentration of helium leakage in a closed garage is mainly determined by the total amount of leakage while the leakage rate affects the gas mixing behavior In addition Jiang H et al14based on the case of 613 explosion accident in Shiyan City Hubei Province calculated the amount of natural gas involved from three perspectives TNT equivalent of explosion energy damage to buildings and overpressure distribution in buildings Some scholars have conducted relevant studies on the gas leakage and diffusion of public pipe corridors From the perspective of gas leakage and diffusion characteristics Lei Peng et al15studied the diffusion of hydrogen leakage in the pipe gallery and found that the contact time after gas injection was long resulting in slow propagation speed Zhou Ning et al16simulated the diffusion process of natural gas in an underground pipeline corridor and found that under the action of wind natural gas diffused in a snail shape and the turbulence intensity increased From the perspective of leakage influencing factors Duan Pengfei et al1718studied the influence of leakage hole direction diameter and hydrogen mixing ratio on natural gas concentration distribution Sun et al19found that higher pipeline pressure increases the amount of gas leaking and accelerates the injection rate leading to concentration stratification Li Jingtao et al20found that increased slope would shorten the alarm response time Zhang Chenglong et al21analyzed the influence of multifactor coupling on leakage and simulated leakage scenario From the perspective of alarm and safety Some scholars analyzed the process of leakage alarm and accident ventilation in the pipe gallery from the Angle of alarm and safety and put forward the alarm scheme1822 However the leakage and diffusion of hydrogendoped natural gas at home and abroad rarely consider the leakage of long and narrow underground structures such as pipe corridors In addition the current study mainly analyzes the gas leakage and diffusion behavior under fixed ventilation frequency and inlet and outlet spacing and neural network prediction is less applied in this area and more work needs to be done to fill these gaps Therefore a numerical model of leakage and diffusion of hydrogendoped natural gas in the integrated pipeline corridor is established in this paper and the difference of concentration distribution and velocity field of hydrogendoped natural gas is analyzed under the conditions of different inlet speed inlet and outlet spacing hydrogen ratio and leakage port size The explosion risk volume of methane and hydrogen under different conditions is predicted by backpropagation neural network GABPANN can accurately model complex nonlinear relationships and process highdimensional data This method can be used for rapid and flexible risk assessment under various conditions and can provide reliable information for safety design It can influence the ventilation design of pipeline corridors the layout design of hydrogendoped natural gas

Sfrackvarepsilon Ssqrt 2SijSij in order to comprehend the concentration distribution and diffusion behavior of hydrogendoped natural gas in the public pipe gallery following leaking As seen in Fig2a a threedimensional physical model of the gas chamber of a 200 m  18 m  24 m common pipe gallery was built The installation spacing of pipes in the independent cabin of the public works pipe gallery is described in Fig2b in accordance with the Chinese national standard GB 50838  2015 Technical Code for Urban Comprehensive Pipe Corridor Engineering32and the pipe gallery is 18 m wide and 24 m high The seamless steel pipe used for the hydrogendoped natural gas pipeline has DN250 400 mm a 500 mm and 800 mm for b1and b2 respectively Considering the current state of engineering design The air inlet and outlet have the same dimensions 1 m by 1 m The pipe gallery is reduced to a long narrow rectangular building that has ventilatable walls on the left and right sides The hydrogendoped natural gas pipeline has a leak hole in the middle of its upper surface The model mainly simulates the diffusion of hydrogendoped natural gas in the pipe gallery after leakage into the atmosphere from small holes and analyzes the effects of ventilation velocity inlet and outlet spacing hydrogen blending ratio and leakage port size on the diffusion of hydrogendoped natural gas Combined with several features of the model a hexahedral meshbased meshing strategy was adopted The grid encryption grid is set up at the air inlet outlet and leak hole for locations prone to large velocity gradients as shown in Fig2c Numerical model a 3D pipe gallery model b installation spacing of pipes in pipe gallery c mesh generation strategy This paper based on the Technical Specifications for Urban Comprehensive Pipe Tunnel Engineering explores the effects of pipe body factors and ventilation conditions on the diffusion behavior of hydrogencontaminated natural gas leaks33 The selected influencing factors are listed in

parameters of mixed gas under different hydrogen mixing ratios can be obtained by calculation as shown in Table4 The FLUENT finite volume method was used to solve the equations related to the conservation of mass momentum and energy36 A hydrogendoped natural gas leakage port an air inlet an air outlet two side outlets a pipe wall and a pipe corridor wall comprise the models primary boundaries The combination of CH4and H2is separated into various proportions within the group and the temperature is set at 300 K The mass flow rate inlet is chosen as the boundary condition of the hydrogendoped natural gas leakage port1036 The group is separated into air and the air inlet is configured as the speed inlet The Outlet boundary condition often refers to the gas outlet end which is set as a Pressure Outlet to simulate the gas diffusion perpendicular to the wall under the action of the airflow In the setting of the wall boundary since thermal analysis is not the focus of this paper the research wall is set as an isothermal wall with a temperature of 300K1736 The boundary condition Settings are shown in Table5 It is assumed that the flow field in the calculation area is in a stable state before the leakage of the natural gas pipeline and the velocity and concentration of methane and hydrogen are 036 The area with a high gradient of data change particularly the area surrounding the leak hole needs to be locally adjusted in order to lower computing complexity and increase numerical accuracy Wind speed of 24 ms intake and outlet spacing of 200 m HBR of 20 and leakage size of 20 mm were the parameters used to study grid independence Four grid schemes with grid numbers of 1202370 1523970 2172970 and 3430000 were used for calculation The variation of methane concentration in the vertical Y direction of the leak hole location under the four grid schemes is shown in Fig3a Mesh quality verification is usually evaluated through a series of quantitative metrics such as maximum skew aspect ratio etc37 Therefore the maximum skew of the four meshes is compared and the results are shown in Fig3b As can be seen from the figure when the number of grids reaches 3430000 the calculation results gradually tend to be stable In order to meet the requirements of simulation accuracy and efficiency the number of meshes used in subsequent simulations was 3430000 Grid validation data a Simulation results verify b Comparison of maximum skewness A leakage and diffusion experiment of hydrogendoped natural gas in a home kitchen was chosen for comparative analysis in order to confirm the accuracy of the numerical model8 The kitchen model data was obtained from the literature and had dimensions of 25 m by 16 m by 26 m as illustrated in Fig4a The leak hole is 8 mm in size with a leakage flow rate of 4 and 8 Nm3h 80 nitrogen and 20 helium The monitoring points 1 076 050 115 5 150 050 168 8 150 050 020 and 9 050 155 205 are displayed in Fig4b and c Simulations and experimental findings on oxygen concentration At these two instances it is evident that the trend of the computer findings and the experimental results is consistent These two leakage flows had maximum and average absolute deviations of 120 and 120 respectively 34 and 160 and 219 The numerical models dependability is confirmed by the deviation value which is within an acceptable range and quite tiny Accuracy verification a 3D model of the kitchen b Comparison of simulation results and experimental results when the leakage flow rate is 4Nm3h c Comparison of the simulation results and experimental results when the leakage flow rate is 8Nm3h Given that the city comprehensive pipe gallerys gas tank has a medium and lowpressure hydrogendoped natural gas pipeline leak this part includes varying wind speeds 14 19 24 and 29 ms input and outlet spacing 50 100 150 and 100 m hydrogen mixing ratio 0 5 10 15 20 and leakage port size 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm 40 mm Influence on leakage and diffusion characteristics of hydrogendoped natural gas in gas tanks in urban integrated pipeline corridors Figure5shows the distribution of the leakage gas concentration field and velocity field in the pipe gallery under different leakage port sizes when the air inlet and outlet spacing is 200 m HBR is 20 and the wind speed is 24 ms Distribution of hydrogendoped natural gas under different leakage pore sizes a concentration field b velocity field As shown in Fig5a as the size of the leakage increases the highvolume fraction of gas above the pipe gallery becomes more concentrated while hydrogendoped natural gas accumulates more around the leakage port beneath the pipeline The concentration beneath the air inlet is mainly concentrated at the top of the pipe gallery though it remains lower than that at the air outlet Notably when the leakage port is 10 mm a stratification phenomenon of hydrogendoped natural gas appears in the pipe gallery This layering effect gradually diminishes as the leakage port size increases When the leakage is 40 mm the overall concentration level in the pipe gallery is significantly high resulting in an extremely hazardous situation As seen in Fig5b the increase in leakage size alters the streamline structure within the pipeline gallery with a substantial expansion of the highvelocity diffusion area When the leakage port size increases to 20 mm the length of the vortex area beneath the air inlet increases causing the streamlines downstream of the pipe gallery to no longer converge and the concentration distribution becomes broader As the leakage port size reaches 40 mm the vortex structure beneath the air inlet disappears The gas accumulation above the pipe gallery increases and the leakage velocity above the leakage port rises sharply Simultaneously part of the leaking gas is carried into the middle and lower spaces of the pipe gallery leading to an increase in gas concentration in the lower areas Changes in the explosion volume of hydrogendoped natural gas under different leakage orifice sizes Figure6illustrates the variation of the explosion volume of hydrogendoped natural gas at different leak orifice sizes Compared with the standard operating condition when the leakage aperture size increased from 20 mm to 40 mm the explosion volume of CH4decreased by 5299 and 9988 respectively The explosion volume of H2increased by 14348 and 21458 When the leakage aperture size is reduced from 20 mm to 10 mm the explosion volume of CH4is reduced by 2923 respectively The H2explosion volume is reduced by 100 Among them the larger the leakage hole the smaller the methane explosion volume in the pipe gallery This phenomenon is mainly because when the natural gas leakage is large the concentration of methane in the confined space will increase rapidly and the methane concentration will soon exceed the upper limit of the explosion UEL After exceeding the UEL the concentration of methane in the gas mixture is too high and the oxygen is insufficient to support combustion or explosion As a result this part of the area where the concentration exceeds the UEL is no longer explosive but out of the blast range The explosion volume of hydrogen can be increased all the time because the upper and lower explosion limits of hydrogen are wide and less limited by the upper and lower explosion limits As the leakage increases the concentration of hydrogen rises rapidly in the confined space and the upper limit of the explosion is less exceeded resulting in an increase in the effective explosion volume Figure7shows the distribution of the leakage gas concentration field and velocity field in the pipe gallery under different hydrogen doping ratios when the spacing between the air inlet and outlet is 200 m the leakage aperture size is 20 mm and the wind speed is 24 ms Distribution of hydrogenblended natural gas with different hydrogen doping volume ratios a concentration field b velocity field Figure7a shows the distribution of the leakage gas concentration field in the pipe gallery Compared with natural gas when the hydrogen blending ratio is 5 and 10 the concentration field does not change obviously and the concentration distribution law is similar When the hydrogen doping ratio is increased to 15 the high volume fraction of gas near the air inlet of the leakage port gathers above the pipe gallery and the gas concentration distribution near the air outlet has little effect When the HBR value is 20 the downwind danger area near the outlet increases significantly but the gas concentration above the pipe gallery in the direction of the air inlet is low and most of the hydrogendoped natural gas gathers below the air outlet and at the top of the pipe gallery It is shown that hydrogen mixing will increase the safety risk of public pipe corridors after pipeline leakage Figure7b shows the velocity field distribution of leakage gas in the pipe gallery Observing the velocity streamlines diagram of different hydrogen doping ratios it can be found that hydrogen doping does not significantly change the streamline structure of the pipeline corridor but only lifts the vortex line near the air inlet and increases the length of the vortex area so that a fast flow area is formed under the pipeline on the left side of the leakage port so that the gas is not easy to accumulate at the bottom of the pipe corridor Variation of the explosion volume of hydrogendoped natural gas under different hydrogendoped volume ratios As can be seen from Fig8 Compared with the standard condition the explosion volume of CH4is reduced by 978 1078 1355 and 1225 respectively when the hydrogen mixture ratio is reduced from 20 to 0 The explosion volume of H2is reduced by 8655 100 100 100 In particular when the hydrogen mixture ratio is 010 the explosion volume of H2is close to 0 the larger the hydrogen doping ratio the larger the explosion volume of methane and hydrogen in the pipe gallery which is mainly related to the explosion limit characteristics and their behavior in the gas mixture One is that the explosion limit LEL and UEL of hydrogen is wider than that of methane With the increase in the number of hydrogen gas integrals in the leaked gas the range of hydrogen concentrations that can form explosive mixtures in the pipe gallery increases The second is that hydrogen diffuses faster than methane After being mixed with hydrogen the mixed gas diffuses faster in the pipe gallery and is easy to form a homogeneous mixture in a larger area This rapid diffusion property may allow larger volumes of gas mixtures to reach the explosive concentration range resulting in an increase in the explosive volumes of methane and hydrogen Therefore in relatively enclosed spaces such as pipe corridors the explosion volume of methane and hydrogen increases significantly This phenomenon requires special attention in industrial safety management to prevent a greater risk of explosion due to increased hydrogen doping Figure9shows the distribution of the leakage gas concentration field and velocity field in the pipe gallery at wind speed when the spacing between the air inlet and outlet is 200 m the HBR is 20 and the leakage aperture size is 20 mm Distribution of hydrogendoped natural gas at different wind speeds a concentration field b velocity field Figure9ashows the distribution of the leakage gas concentration field in the pipe gallery It can be seen that with the increase in wind speed the gas concentration at the air inlet decreases significantly and the hydrogendoped natural gas with a high volume fraction no longer gathers above the pipe gallery at the air inlet According to the concentration distribution of hydrogendoped natural gas at the air outlet it can be seen that with the increase in wind speed the high volume fraction of gas accumulation above the pipe gallery at the air outlet and the accumulation degree of hydrogendoped natural gas below the pipeline is also reduced On the whole the increase in wind speed reduces the concentration of hydrogendoped natural gas in the pipe gallery as a whole and the danger range is reduced Figure9bshows the velocity field distribution of leaked gas in the pipe gallery With the increase of wind speed the vortex area below the air inlet gradually increases and more hydrogendoped natural gas with a high volume fraction enters the downstream of the pipe gallery through the vortex which accelerates the gas flow in the overall pipe gallery space The velocity streamlines below the air outlet gradually move downward pushing the high volume fraction of gas under the pipe to flow to the air outlet which reduces the accumulation of hydrogendoped natural gas at the bottom of the pipe gallery to a certain extent Variation of the explosion volume of hydrogendoped natural gas at different inlet wind speeds As can be seen from Fig10 Compared with the standard condition when the inlet wind speed increases from 24 ms to 29 ms the explosion volume of CH4decreases by 3568 and that of H2decreases by 2050 When the inlet wind speed decreased from 24 ms to 14 ms the explosion volume of CH4first decreased by 379 and then increased by 2043 The explosion volume of H2first decreases by 028 and then increases by 891 So the methane explosion volume dropped even more In confined spaces the larger the ventilation velocity the smaller the explosion volume of methane and hydrogen leakage which is mainly related to the dilution effect of ventilation on methane and hydrogen concentrations and the control of mixed gas concentrations Ventilation can dilute the concentration of leaking gases As the number of ventilations increases fresh air entering the space can dilute leaked methane and hydrogen making them less concentrated in the air When ventilation is strong enough the concentration of methane and hydrogen falls below the lower explosion limit LEL reducing or completely eliminating the volume of explosive gases It can be seen that with proper ventilation design the leaking hydrogendoped natural gas can be quickly controlled below the safe concentration thus effectively preventing the risk of explosion The effect of ventilation on the volume reduction of methane and hydrogen explosions in confined spaces varies mainly related to the explosion limit molecular mass and diffusivity of methane and hydrogen Methane and hydrogen have different explosion limits Methane has a narrow explosion limit of 515 volume fraction while hydrogen has a wide explosion limit of 475 This means that even at low concentrations hydrogen can still cause an explosion while methane only explodes in a relatively small concentration range Secondly hydrogen has a smaller molecular mass 2 gmol and therefore diffuses faster in the air Hydrogen diffuses more easily and occupies a larger space In summary although ventilation can reduce the explosion volume of methane and hydrogen due to the wide explosion limit fast diffusion and fast flame propagation speed of hydrogen ventilation often requires stricter control and more effective ventilation design to reduce the risk of hydrogen explosion Figure11shows the distribution of the leakage gas concentration field and velocity field in the pipe gallery under different inlet and outlet spacing when the leakage aperture size is 20 mm the HBR is 20 and the wind speed is 24 ms Distribution of hydrogendoped natural gas at different inlet and outlet spacing a concentration field b velocity field Figure11a shows the distribution of the leakage gas concentration field in the pipe gallery On the whole when the spacing between the air inlets and outlets is 50 m the overall concentration level of the pipe gallery is the lowest and the area of highvolume hydrogendoped natural gas distribution is the smallest When the spacing is 50 m the second air inlet is located above the leakage resulting in a low distribution of hydrogendoped natural gas upstream of the pipe gallery and at the same time it works together with the air inlet at 200 m to aggregate the gas at the air outlet of 150 m resulting in the smallest aggregation of hydrogendoped natural gas with high volume fraction When the spacing is 100 m the air outlet is located above the leakage port and the leaked gas can directly escape out of the pipe gallery due to the joint action of its own jet and the air inlet on both sides but because there is only one air outlet the overall concentration level is higher than that of 50 m As the spacing between the air inlets and outlets increases the overall concentration level increases and the hazard range increases It shows that the distance between the air outlet and the leakage point greatly affects the concentration level of hydrogendoped natural gas in the pipe gallery Figure11b shows the velocity field distribution of leakage gas in the pipe gallery Observing the cloud image it can be seen that the increase of the spacing between the inlet and outlet has little effect on the velocity on the center line of the jet but completely changes the streamline of the diffusion of hydrogendoped natural gas When the spacing between the air inlets and outlets is 50 m the air intakes on both sides and in the center of the pipe gallery promote the diffusion of hydrogendoped natural gas to the air outlets on the left and right sides of the leakage port and the overall fluidity is strong When the spacing between the air inlet and outlet is 100 m the air outlet is located above the leakage port and the air inlets on both sides promote the diffusion of hydrogendoped natural gas out of the pipe gallery The concentration distribution of the air inlet and outlet spacing of 150 m and the spacing of 200 m is similar but the shorter the spacing the shorter the distance of hydrogendoped natural gas diffusion which is conducive to the reduction of the concentration level of hydrogendoped natural gas in the pipe gallery Variation of the explosion volume of hydrogendoped natural gas at different inlet and outlet spacing As shown in Fig12 Compared with the standard working condition when the inlet and outlet spacing is reduced from 200 m to 50 m the explosion volume of CH4is reduced by 4981 321 and 9992 and the explosion volume of H2is reduced by 812 and 100 This phenomenon is closely related to factors such as ventilation efficiency gas diffusion behavior and concentration distribution When the spacing between the air inlets and outlets of the pipe gallery is large the ventilation efficiency will be reduced As the airflow passes through the corridor over long distances it gradually weakens resulting in a decrease in the velocity of the airflow The reduced ventilation efficiency means that the leaking gas cannot be quickly discharged or diluted in the pipe gallery and tends to accumulate in some areas and methane and hydrogen can easily accumulate and reach concentrations between the lower explosion limit LEL and the upper limit UEL thus increasing the explosion volume in that area The longdistance air inlet and outlet will lead to the formation of a clear gas concentration gradient in the pipe gallery that is the concentration is higher in the area near the leakage source and the concentration may be lower in the area away from the air outlet Among them when the spacing between air inlets and outlets increases from 100 m to 200 m the explosion volume of methane decreases first and then increases This is because the explosive volume of hydrogen gas increases rapidly due to the accumulation of airflow which occupies a large amount of pipe gallery space Then with the increase of the spacing between the air inlets and outlets the accumulation effect of the airflow is further strengthened the volume fraction of hydrogen is smaller and the diffusion degree is limited so the explosion volume of methane increases Latin Hypercube Sampling LHS is a hierarchical stochastic process that provides an efficient way to sample variables from a given distribution38 For the four factors studied LHS was sampled within their respective ranges The value ranges are leakage flow velocity 0024703958 kgs hydrogen doping ratio 020 wind speed 1429 ms and air inlet and outlet spacing 50200 m The sampled experimental data are shown in Table6 In order to eliminate the influence of dimensions on the prediction results the data need to be normalized39 The maximumminimum normalization method is usually used to normalize the sample data into the 01 interval as shown in Eq 19 Wherexiandxiprime is the data before and after standardizationxhboxmax andxhboxmin is the maximum and minimum value of the sample data The way the human brain functions is the basis for modeling backpropagation neural networks The most popular neural network model at the moment is the BPNN algorithm An input layer a hidden layer and an output layer are all part of BPNN40 The acquired simulation data is used to train and learn hidden layer neurons which reflect the inputoutput relationship Following adequate education the studys findings were reviewed The trained model can be used to forecast new outputs once the learning outcomes are approved Thus BPNNs can be used to address complicated nonlinear problems The explosion danger volume of hydrogen and methane in the pipe gallery was predicted in this investigation using BPNN In this study the leakage orifice d hydrogen doping ratio HBR wind speed vand inlet and outlet spacingD were found in the input layer There are four input points in the input layer and the output layer includes the explosion volume Vgas of methane and hydrogen The relationship between input and output can be expressed as Eq 20 A BPNN with a threelayer prediction model was developed in order to derive the explosion volume V of hydrogen and methane at the maximum horizontal diffusion distance from this unknown function As seen in Fig 1441 there are one node in the output layer and four nodes in the input layer The number of neurons in the hidden layer can be obtained according to the Kolmogorov theorem or through the training test of different hidden layer node numbers The more nodes the easier to overfit the fewer nodes will increase the error Usually the approximate interval of

failures is 6 times the output layer neurons transfer function is chosen as a pure line and the hidden layer neurons transfer function is chosen as transit Neural network topology The accuracy of the final prediction findings is significantly impacted by the weights and thresholds that are first established in BPANN Local optimality may arise during model execution if these parameters are assigned at random using conventional procedures4344 The genetic algorithm to optimize the back propagation neural network can improve the generalization ability of the model and avoid falling into the overfitting problem The genetic algorithm optimizes the initial weights and biases through the global search ability which overcomes the limitation that the traditional BP neural network is easy to fall into the local optimum thus reducing the overfitting of the model to the training data The selection function is the geometric selection of the norm the mutation function is the uncombined

viability is confirmed by the training set datas R2of 084 and 091 and the test set datas R2of 083 and 085 This research uses numerical simulation to model the diffusion distribution of hydrogendoped natural gas in the extensive pipe gallery Analysis was done on the impacts of various parameters on the hydrogen explosion volume methane concentration field distribution and velocity field distribution of hydrogendoped natural gas BPNN was used to establish a prediction model of the explosion volume of methane and hydrogen after diffusion stabilization of hydrogendoped natural gas under multifactor coupling The conclusion is as follows 1 The centerline of the hydrogendoped natural gas jets jet in the nearfield region is greatly influenced by the leakage holes diameter As the leakage holes size increases the explosion volume of hydrogen rapidly increases while the explosion volume of methane first increases and then decreases The majority of the hydrogendoped natural gas is collected at the top of the pipe gallery and beneath the air outlet and the explosion volume of hydrogen and methane in the pipe gallery increases with the hydrogen blending ratio The horizontal jet centerline of the hydrogendoped natural gas is also deflected upward earlier 2 With the increase of wind speed the gas concentration at the air inlet decreases significantly and the hydrogendoped natural gas with high volume fraction no longer gathers above the pipe gallery at the air inlet and the explosion volume of methane and hydrogen in the pipe gallery decreases The distance between the air outlet and the leakage point greatly affects the concentration level of hydrogendoped natural gas in the pipe gallery and the longdistance air inlet and outlet will lead to the formation of an obvious gas concentration gradient in the pipe gallery that is the concentration is higher in the area near the leakage source and the concentration may be lower in the area far away from the air outlet 3 A GABPNN surrogate model that can be used to predict the dangerous explosion volume of methane and hydrogen was established The R2 of the training set data and the R2 of the test set data are 083 and 085 respectively which verifies the accuracy of the surrogate model 4 According to the results of the study reasonable design of Distance between inlet and outlet and air flow configuration can help to quickly discharge harmful gases and ensure safe evacuation and equipment maintenance in the pipe gallery in an emergency Therefore in the design of pipeline infrastructure for important facilities or highrisk areas a reasonable mixing ratio of hydrogen should be designed and ensured within the safety threshold of pipeline operation Moreover the spacing and wind speed of the inlet and outlet of the pipe corridor should be optimized so that the air can be evenly distributed in the pipe corridor to prevent the accumulation of gas in local areas so as to effectively reduce the risk of explosion 5 Future studies can conduct field experiments in different regions and different types of pipe corridors to collect actual data to validate the simulation model and provide a basis for further optimization of the design Sensor technology can also be combined with artificial intelligence such as deep learning to develop realtime gas concentration monitoring and explosion risk warning systems to improve the safety of pipe corridors The data can be provided by the corresponding author if needed Field R A  Derwent R G Global warming consequences of replacing natural gas with hydrogen

with the industry and separate your business from the competition As a business owner one of the things I like is that RightDraw gives us a level of professionalism whether its a specialty home or a basic starter home Within the past year we have actually picked up new accounts because our customers were so impressed by the professionalism of our designs particularly when we go up against contractors who are giving them what amounts to a crayon rendition on a napkin Ive always been a proponent of proper sizing of air conditioning equipment For a standard 3000 square foot 4 bedroom house doing the load calculations manually would take many hours Then I found Wrightsoft and by using their RightJ and RightD I was able to produce load calculations and duct design in about an hour Hands down the best tool for the job Our HVAC partners love the 2line mode drawings and the export to REMRate module saves me at least 2 hours per project Thats a real game changer for us in terms of billable hours and revenue Mike sales and Donald tech support have been there for us for over 10 years Keep up the good work and thanks again guys  Just another loyal happy customer We are primarily a residential replacement air conditioning and heating company in Clearwater Florida We found a serious issue with improperly sized air conditioning systems in existing homes that was causing issues with humidity or lack of cooling We have used Manual J for over 30 years but due to the timeconsuming process of entering information manually it was not done unless we had a consumer complaint We partnered with Wrightsoft over 15 years ago and can now do a Manual J Load Calculation in less than 30 minutes Wrightsoft is always there for us with tech support staff that answers the phone quickly and offer advice when needed There is also a library of how to videos available 24 hours a day on their website Wrightsoft has continued to be the best option for us for Manual J load calculations I reached out to technical support to complete an advanced task Technical support responded within an hour or two guided me through the process and even QCd my spreadsheet making corrections needed I was really impressed Ive found that my questions are always answered usually within hours and theres never an attempt to dodge an issue Wrightsofts responsiveness on the support side is what truly sets you apart Your team has made my life easier and using RSU has become an integral cornerstone to the work I do guiding our teams in the design and construction of high performance soon to be ZNE affordable housing Ive been using Wrightsoft since the late 80s Public Service Company in Oklahomas Good Cents program required an ACCA Manual J load calculation and ACCA Manual D duct design to qualify as a Good Cents structure As long as the information is entered correctly Wrightsoft takes all of the guesswork out of the equation It has given me peace of mind and keeps our quality of installation above the rest I cant imagine doing an install without it its as important to us as the rest of the tools on our trucks The Wrightsoft experience has been great from the beginning to end Their support staff are patient and professional Proper equipment sizing is imperative regarding our customers comfort We have been able to provide our customers with accurate professional data to backup our proposals awarding us multiple projects over our competitors Well worth the investment of time and money If youre a Wrightsoft user and have been wanting to go to the next level RightCAD is it Im not conversant with CAD but I was up and running with 3D almost immediately importing some of my more complex duct designs already created with RSU and amazed at seeing what I could only imagine before The 3rd dimension takes the guesswork out of interstitial duct runs navigating dropped ceiling areas dropped girders etc Learning curve is simplified by utilizing the familiar tools  tabs already within RSU and yet with lots of bells and whistles for rainy day exploration and further fine tuning of design presentation I see this as the future of professional  field ready HVAC design

httpswwwomnicalculatorcomphysicswetbulb,Wet Bulb Calculator,With humidity and temperature you can find out the value of the wetbulb temperature and if its any different from the normal air temperature,Based on1 source Table of contents With many countries reported their highest ever temperatures such asCanadareaching 496 C its important that you understand the different factors affecting heat and the bodys ability to regulate it What many people might fail to take into account is the combined result of the heat and humidity  thewet bulb effect This tool will teach you about the wet bulb and lets you estimate its scale The wet bulb calculator operates on a simple principle You can use it to work out the wet bulb temperature from just two numbers temperature and relative humidity Keep reading if you want to discover some wetbulb applications what the military benefits of the WetBulb Globe Temperature are and what it has to do with our health especially within the context of our scorching summers Despite what you might think at first wetbulb temperature has nothing to do with light bulbs It is instead the temperature read by a special thermometer that is wrapped in watersoaked fabric and ventilated This thermometer is part of a device called a psychrometer It includes a drybulb thermometer a wetbulb thermometer and a psychrometric chart  a graph that plots the relationships between the dry and wetbulb temperature relative humidity and dew point at constant pressure By definition wetbulb temperature isthe lowest temperature a portion of air can acquire by evaporative cooling only When air is at its maximum 100  humidity the wetbulb temperature is equal to the normal air temperature drybulb temperature As the humidity decreases the wetbulb temperature becomes lower than the normal air temperature Data about the wetbulb temperature is essential when it comes to preventing our body from overheating Our bodies sweat to cool off but because water evaporates slower in more humid conditions we cool down a lot slower in humid conditions This causes our internal body temperature to rise If the wetbulb temperature exceeds35 C 95 Ffor an extended period of time then people in the surrounding area are at risk ofhyperthermia Although many equations have been created over the years our calculator uses the Stull formula which is accurate for relative humidities between 5 and 99 and temperatures between 20C and 50C It loses its accuracy in situations where both moisture and heat are low in value but even then the error range is only between 1C to 065C The wetbulb calculator is based on the following formula It might look intimidating but dont worry  we do all the calculations for you Just input two numbers Tfootnotesize TT Temperature  air temperature or drybulb temperature is the temperature given by a thermometer not exposed to direct sunlight RHfootnotesize RH RH Relative humidity  a ratio of how much water vapor is in the air to how much it could contain at a given temperature Sometimes the humidity is so high you feel like you could make use of thedensity calculator Remember that both temperature and wet bulb temperature in this formula are expressed in C If you would like to use other units you need to convert them to the Celsius scale before you start calculations The wetbulb temperature might not be a widely known measure but it has some valuable functions Construction different materials react differently to different humidities so this temperature is needed when designing a building in different climates Snowmaking snow production needs low temperatures and when the humidity decreases the temperature rises Meteorology forecasters use wetbulb temperature to predict rain snow or freezing rain You may find useful here WetBulb Globe Temperature is a kind of an apparent temperature  the temperature perceived by humans  used to estimate the effect of temperature humidity wind speed and sunlight on humans Athletes industrial hygienists and the military use it to prevent heat stroke by following guidelines for physical activity and water intake WetBulb Globe Temperature is determined by the following equation whereTgfootnotesize Tmathrm gTg the globe thermometer temperature  is measured by a thermometer situated in a black globe It allows for the estimation of direct solar radiation Measured indoors without direct solar radiationsunlight the WetBulb Globe Temperature uses a shortened formula WetBulb Globe Temperature gives us vital information if we want to be safe on warmer days Awet bulb is a thermometerin which the bulb is wrapped in a wet cloth It can be used tomeasure the lowest temperature to which air can be cooledby evaporating water at constant pressure Basically it is ametaphor for human sweatand it will tell you how thehuman body would feel in direct sunlight Quite comfortable wetbulb temperature is around70 F 22 C but no more than86 F 30 C Above this temperature physical labor becomes impossible Thehigher the wetbulb temperature thehigher the risk of severe heat stress No BothWetBulb Globe TemperatureWBGT andHeat Indexmeasure thehuman bodys ability to resist stress from heat What they have in common is thatthey both take into account temperature and relative humidity The fundamental difference is thatWBGT is calculated with temperature measured in the sun whileHeat Index is calculated in the shade Also WGBT takes into account more parameters 16384 C Calculate this in a few steps Use the formula for wetbulb temperature Tw T

representation of algorithms although intuitive is not very useful for different tasks such as the description of quantum circuits in text environments the calculation of quantum states or the optimization of quantum circuits While classical circuits can be represented either by circuit graphs or by Boolean expressions quantum circuits have until now predominantly been illustrated as circuit graphs because no formal language for quantum circuits that allows algebraic manipulations has so far been accepted This work proposes a means to represent quantum circuits in a convenient and concise manner similar to the way Boolean expressions are used in classical circuits The proposed notation allows the consistent and parameterized description of quantum algorithms as well as the easy handling of the elements that compose it to achieve powerful optimizations in the number of gates of the circuits To visualize it a software implementation of an algebraic quantum circuit framework has been made which allows describing quantum circuits as well as their respective state vectors using the proposed algebraic language Piotr Ogonowski and Piotr Skindzier 2025Phys Scr100015018 Alena Tensor is a recently discovered class of energymomentum tensors that provides mathematical framework in which as demonstrated in previous publications the description of a physical system in curved spacetime and its description in flat spacetime with fields are equivalent The description of a system with electromagnetic field based on Alena Tensor can be used to reconcile physical descriptions 1 In curvilinear description Einstein Field equations were obtained with Cosmological Constant related to the invariant of the electromagnetic field tensor which can be interpreted as negative pressure of vacuum filled with electromagnetic field 2 In classical description for flat spacetime three densities of fourforces were obtained electromagnetic against gravity counteraction to gravitational freefall and the force responsible for the AbrahamLorentz effect radiation reaction force Obtained connection of Einstein tensor with gravity and radiation reaction force after transition to curvilinear description excludes black hole singularities There was obtained Lagrangian density and generalized canonical fourmomentum containing electromagnetic fourpotential and a term responsible for the other two forces In this description charged particles cannot remain at complete rest and should have spin their energy results from the existence of energy of magnetic moment and the density of this energy is part of the Poynting fourvector The distribution of charged matter was expressed as polarizationmagnetization stressenergy tensor what may explain why gravity is invisible in QED 3 In quantum picture QED Lagrangian density simplification was obtained and the Dirac Schrödinger and KleinGordon equations may be considered as approximations of the obtained quantum solution Farther use of Alena Tensor in unification applications was also discussed Howard N Southgate 2025Phys Scr100015261 New ordinary differential equations ODEs for the evolution of spectral components are derived from the complex GinzburgLandau equation CGLe for onedimensional spatial domains without boundaries free evolution and with one fixed boundary semifree evolution For such evolution a complex or imaginary diffusion term creates a tendency for waves to lengthen This requires a novel ansatz and auxiliary condition that treat wavenumbers as timevarying The ansatz consists of a discrete spatial Fourier transform modified with a timedependent wavenumber for the peak spectral component The wavenumbers of the other components are fixed relative to this wavenumber The new auxiliary condition is the terminal condition for complex diffusion after wavenumbers evolve to zero they remain at zero The derived free and semifree ODEs are solved along characteristic lines located symmetrically about a fixed spatial point Waves lengthen with time away from this point in both directions Laboratory experiments on the formation of channel sandbars theoretically described by the CGLe show two regions whose evolutionary behaviour is qualitatively predicted by the free and semifree evolution equations This analysis applies to other timedependent partial differential equations with complex or imaginary diffusion terms New freely evolving solutions are derived for the complex heat equation and Schrödinger equation linear and nonlinear S B Dugdale 2016Phys Scr91053009 The concept of the Fermi surface is at the very heart of our understanding of the metallic state Displaying intricate and often complicated shapes the Fermi surfaces of real metals are both aesthetically beautiful and subtly powerful A range of examples is presented of the startling array of physical phenomena whose origin can be traced to the shape of the Fermi surface together with experimental observations of the particular Fermi surface features M N Khanet al2020Phys Scr95045701 The present study is a comparative energy and exergy analysis of a Proposed gas turbine cycle PGTC with a simple gas turbine cycle SGTC maintaining the same rate of fuel supply in both cycles In the PGTC the air bottoming cycle is operated by exhaust gases from the topping gas turbine cycle by exchanging heat in the heat exchangers HEs by controlling the path of exhaust gases and compressed air through the bypass control valves The bypass valve in the topping as well as the bottoming cycle direct the combustible product from the combustion chamber to the HE in such a way that it optimizes the performance of the proposed combined cycle as compared to SGTC The results show that the maximum increase in Work net output and thermal efficiency in PGTC compared to SGTC is 657 atrp 4 and turbine inlet temperature TIT  1500 K whereas the exergy loss by the exhaust gases in the PGTC is much less than the exergy loss by the exhaust gases in the SGTC The maximum difference in the exergy loss by the exhaust gases in PGTC and SGTC is also observed atrp 4 and TIT  1500 K Jack Smith 2022Phys Scr97122001 First conceptualised in Olaf Stapledons 1937 novel Star Maker before being popularised by Freeman Dyson in the 1960s Dyson Spheres are structures which surround a civilisations sun to collect all the energy being radiated This article presents a discussion of the features of such a feat of engineering reviews the viability scale and likely design of a Dyson structure and analyses details about each stage of its construction and operation It is found that a Dyson Swarm a large array of individual satellites orbiting another celestial body is the ideal design for such a structure as opposed to the solid sunsurrounding structure which is typically associated with the Dyson Sphere In our solar system such a structure based around Mars would be able to generate the Earths 2019 global power consumption of 1835 TW within fifty years once its construction has begun which itself could start by 2040 using biennial launch windows Alongside a 417 km2groundbased heliostat array the swarm of over 55 billion satellites would be constructed on the surface of Mars before being launched by electromagnetic accelerators into a Martian orbit Efficiency of the Dyson Swarm ranges from 074277 of the Suns 3851026W output with large potential for growth as both current technologies improve and future concepts are brought to reality in the time before and during the swarms construction Not only would a Dyson Swarm provide a nearinfinite renewable power source for Earth it would also allow for significant expansions in human space exploration and for our civilisation as a whole Ulrik L

with current stateoftheart siliconbased counterparts This steepest growth of the PCEs suggests that the commercialization of this technology might be easing the energy transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy However a wide range of factors restrict the commercial viability of PSCs like their toxicity and instability A crucial and difficult task in the field of PSCs is the replacement of

a Raman soliton selfpolarization shift RSSPS effect driven by the self and crossfrequency shift that are induced by the stimulated Raman scattering SRS which is modeled by two coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations in a circular polarization basis Particularly the propagation of the fundamental vector soliton as a sechsquared temporal pulse profile is also governed by a compensation balance between dispersion and Kerr effect In this analysis the numerical approach for solving the propagation problem is studied in detail Additionally for a better understanding of the vector soliton dynamics the pulse propagation governed by linear and nonlinear effects considering their individual contributions as well as their simultaneous interplay are studied by spectrograms which represent the temporalspectral distribution of the pulse profile As a result the fundamental vector soliton which maintains its temporal envelope over propagation validates a temporal walkoff along propagation that is consistent with a redshifted spectral evolution at the same time the polarization evolution is correlated with this pulse dynamics Jing Wanget al2025Phys Scr100015542 We investigate solitons in nonlinear media with oscillatory nonlocal response which are confined within a rectangular boundary We find that the profile of soliton exhibits a nearly Gaussian shape regardless of the boundary value and is located in the center of the rectangle The profile of nonlinear refractive index which exhibits a bellshaped or oscillatory pattern is strongly related to the value of the boundary and the degree of nonlocality The normalized amplitude can also influence the profile of nonlinear refractive index The stability of the soliton depends on its location within the domain defined by the function relationship curve of the propagation constant and the boundary the degree of nonlocality or the normalized amplitude We further demonstrate the robustness of soliton propagation by the application of initial transverse velocity on solitons and the incident of solitons deviating from the center of the system resulting in a snakeshaped propagation and chaoticonshaped pattern Open all

tackle the above problem we propose a novel model in this study that combines information from the spatial and frequency domains Unlike most existing methods We also investigate the relationship

the MASTU machine description in FreeGSNKEFiesta and reproduce the equilibria in the shots shown Yan Liuet al2025Phys Scr The problem of lowfrequency noise is becoming increasingly severe and measuring the sound absorption performance of acoustic metamaterials AMs using accurate absorption coefficients is of great interest in lowfrequency noise control engineering Conventional calculation methods such as Finite Element Method FEM simulations and the theoretical analysis methods TAM have specific limitations Deep learning DL models provide new perspectives for studying AMs acoustic performance However the prediction performance of DL models is highly dependent on the proper tuning of hyperparameters As far as is known existing literature has not systematically explored the impact of hyperparameter tuning on DL models in the context of acoustic performance studies The present paper designed a multidimensional Helmholtz resonator MDHR consisting of a 4x4type continuous parallel arrangement while a dataset was established via FEM Furthermore a deep neural network HPODNNs model based on hyperparameter optimization HPO was proposed to predict the acoustic performance of the MDHR Random search RS Bayesian optimization BO Simulated annealing SA and genetic algorithm GA were introduced to optimize the hyperparameters learning rate weight decay optimizer and batch size of the DNNs The mean square error MSE coefficient of determination R2 of the testing dataset and the optimization time were used as the evaluation metrics GA was selected for further study based on the comparison results MSE000177 R2098151 of the optimization efficiency and predictive precision of DNNs from the four HPO algorithms Finally the prediction performance of the GADNNs model was evaluated in single multi and broadband conditions in practical applications demonstrating high precision and stability and providing a new approach for acoustics performance studies Mohamed Kahilet al2025Phys Scr This study investigates the influence of relativistic effects on some atomic properties of the halogen group and gold atoms including their ions 1 The analysis covers radii orbitals energy first and second ionization energies electron affinity and polarizability The study confirms that the p12orbitals contract under relativistic effects whereas for the p32 orbitals the massvelocity and spinorbit effects do not appear to cancel each other out completely This may indicate that the spinorbit effect grows when increasing the atomic number slightly faster than the massvelocity effect In addition expansion of the np32 orbitals may lead to dilation of the bond length in the related molecules We found that the nonrelativistic HartreeFock method gave for atoms from fluorine to iodine first ionization energy values with smaller deviations from their experimental ones than other methods involving relativistic and correlation effects In particular the method accurately up to three significative digits predicts the experimental value for chlorine and thus can be adopted discarding other sophisticated methods considering the huge computational effort required by them while not improving much on the agreement with experiment when evaluating physicalchemical properties of large systems containing light halogen elements It also predicts an electron affinity of 24 eV for the tennessine atom where it shows also that the relativistic effects play a more important role than in gold atomsxD Mansoor Sheikh and David Saad 2025Phys Scr Medical diagnostic testing can be made significantly more efficient using pooled testing protocols These typically require a sparse infection signal and use either binary or realvalued entries of O1 However existing methods do not allow for inferring viral loads which span many orders of magnitude We develop a message passing algorithm coupled with a PCR Polymerase Chain Reaction specific noise function to allow accurate inference of realistic viral load signals A version of the Combinatorial Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm is employed to compare the obtained inference results with those of our probabilistic message passing This work is in the nonadaptive setting and could open the possibility of efficient screening where viral load determination is clinically important Eduardo Alberto SuárezPérez and Renato Lemus 2025Phys Scr A discrete variable representation DVR approach in the framework of the 2D Cartesian basis is studied to take into account the symmetry of both the potential and the basis textcolorblackThree cases are analyzed a rectangular well potential where the basis carries the symmetry of the system the circular potential where the DVR points are not compatible with the boundary conditions of the potential and a quartic potential in Cartesian coordinates A truncation method of the basis is also proposed to assure rapid convergence The computational time and memory involved in the calculations are drastically reduced when compared to previous analysis where the symmetry was taken into account using a different approach Ebrahim Aziziet al2025Phys Scr Magnetic particle imaging MPI is a tracerbased tomographic imaging technique utilized in applications such as lung perfusion imaging cancer diagnosis stem cell tracking etc The goal of translating MPI to clinical use has prompted studies on further improving the spatialtemporal resolutions of MPI through various methods including image reconstruction algorithm scanning trajectory design magnetic field profile design and tracer design Iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles MNPs are favored for MPI and magnetic resonance imaging MRI over other materials due to their high biocompatibility low cost and ease of preparation and surface modification For coreshell MNPs the tracers magnetic core size and nonmagnetic coating layer characteristics can significantly affect MPI signals through dynamic magnetization relaxations Most works to date have assumed an ensemble of MNP tracers with identical sizes ignoring that artificially synthesized MNPs typically follow a lognormal size distribution which can deviate theoretical results from experimental data In this work we first characterize the size distributions of four commercially available iron oxide MNP products and then model the collective magnetic responses of these MNPs for MPI applications For an ensemble of MNP tracers with size standard deviations of  we applied a stochastic Langevin model to study the effect of size distribution on MPI imaging performance Under an alternating magnetic field AMF ie the excitation field in MPI we collected the time domain dynamic magnetizations Mt curves magnetizationfield hysteresis loops MH curves pointspread functions PSFs dMdHH curves and higher harmonics from these MNP tracers The intrinsic MPI spatial resolution which is related to the full width at half maximum FWHM of the PSF profile along with the higher harmonics serve as metrics to provide insights into how the size distribution of MNP tracers affects MPI performance J J Navaet al2025Phys Scr100025913 The hexagonalphase of bulk Be3N2is a wide band gap semiconductor with potential ultraviolet UV optoelectronics applications Here we have performed the first theoretical study of the electronic and optical properties of thephase of Be3N2considering manybody effects In particular we have obtained the electronic band structure and spectra of the dielectric function complex refractive index and electron energy loss function For the calculation of the band structure both Density Functional Theory and G0W0approximation plus Wannier interpolation of the bands have been applied For the calculation of the optical spectra we have employed both the independent particle approach as well as the formalism that incorporates manybody and excitonic effects by applying G0W0approximation and solving the BetheSalpeter equation BSE The results show for instance that the spectrum of the imaginary part of the dielectric function ofBe3N2has an anisotropic behavior Even more the material shows its highest absorption peak in the UV range which makes it interesting due to its possible hightemperature photodetection applications Also in the visible energy range of the spectrum the index of refraction along thezaxis see figure 1 is predicted to be around 16 which is a high value for a solid More Open Access articles

For the Valley News The Clean Heat Standard CHS part of Act 18 of 2023 had the overall aim of reducing the use of fossil fuels for heating in Vermont It would do this primarily by providing incentives for the air sealing and insulating of buildings and the adoption of alternative heating technologies Act 18 did not implement the CHS but instead required the Public Utility Commission to study the idea and issue a detailed report Given the current political reality in Vermont the CHS is not going to move ahead in its present form but I want to write about how we got here and the implications for future policy The commission released its report on Jan 15 It found that the initial cost of the program would be about 8 or 9 cents per gallon of heating fuel a far cry from the projections from folks who opposed the bill who predicted the increase in fuel costs to be anywhere from 70 cents to 4 or more per gallon The reports projection is very much in line with the estimates that proponents of the bill had originally anticipated and much less than was feared by many In addition costs are only one part of the equation Equally important are the benefits Given these relatively modest costs the benefits of the program would have likely greatly outweighed them We would have seen otherwise untapped savings in efficiency more stable prices for heating and more money kept in our local economy The Clean Heat Standard is opposed primarily by two groups The first is the deeppocketed fossil fuel industry This is no surprise as the proposed law would have accelerated the transition away from their products and cost them some future profits They did a fine job of scaring Vermonters with wildly exaggerated projections for price increases and is a great example of an industry that successfully puts its interests above that of ordinary people Id like to note here that there are many local fuel dealers in the state that have started diversifying their businesses on their own and supported the CHS as they saw it as a way for them to both ease their transition away from fossil fuels and a way to help their customers do so as well The other group is composed of folks who believe that markets will naturally solve most of our problems and that government action is usually misguided at best and terribly harmful at worst Markets can be a powerful tool for allocating scarce resources but markets that are not properly regulated are prone to abuse Monopolies that enrich themselves at the expense of everyone else are the most obvious example of this but there are many others A core responsibility of our government is to set the rules for how markets behave so that the benefits of our economy are broadly enjoyed and not appropriated by small groups Unfortunately recent statistics on income and wealth inequality show that weve been abdicating this responsibility Life is quite good if youre in the top 10 or so but much harder as you move down the economic ladder All markets have rules that govern them Some are set by private interests and some by the government A great deal of the power in our society lies in who controls those rules Article continues after CrossWord Flipart Typeshift SpellTower Really Bad Chess The energy sector in Vermont is a nice case study in the difference between highly and lightly regulated markets The electric power companies and their prices are highly regulated oil prices are not A result of this is that cost increases for power tend to be modest and predictable Contrast this with oil prices which can change quickly and dramatically sometimes with disastrous consequences especially for families with modest incomes Of course not all aspects of our economy need to be tightly regulated We need to be judicious and recognize that the world is always changing We must pay attention and be responsive Governments dont always get policy right Its not hard to find examples of laws that did exactly the opposite of their intent This does not mean the governments should shy away from their responsibility to be a strong vehicle for our collective action In many ways this is what democracy is all about The big issues we are facing today  housing health care education and climate resilience  are not going to solve themselves We must take collective action and this will largely mean changes in state policy We will need to make hard choices we will need to stand up to narrow interests and fight for the common good we will need to be creative and brave We will make mistakes We always have We will need to learn from them do better and move on That is how we make progress Rep Larry Satcowitz DRandolph represents the OrangeWashingtonAddison district in the Vermont House 01102025 1001 PM 01072025

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation,Heat equation - Wikipedia,No description,"Inmathematicsandphysics, theheat equationis aparabolic partial differential equation. The theory of the heat equation was first developed byJoseph Fourierin 1822 for the purpose of modeling how a quantity such asheatdiffuses through a given region. Since then, the heat equation and its variants have been found to be fundamental in many parts of both pure and applied mathematics. Given an open subsetUofRnand a subintervalIofR, one says that a functionuUIRis a solution of theheat equationif wherex1, ...,xn,tdenotes a general point of the domain. It is typical to refer totas time andx1, ...,xnas spatial variables, even in abstract contexts where these phrases fail to have their intuitive meaning. The collection of spatial variables is often referred to simply asx. For any given value oft, the right-hand side of the equation is theLaplacianof the functionu,t UR. As such, the heat equation is often written more compactly as utΔudisplaystyle frac partial upartial tDelta u In physics and engineering contexts, especially in the context of diffusion through a medium, it is more common to fix aCartesian coordinate systemand then to consider the specific case of afunctionux,y,z,tof three spatial variablesx,y,zandtimevariablet. One then says thatuis a solution of the heat equation if in whichαis a positivecoefficientcalled thethermal diffusivityof the medium. In addition to other physical phenomena, this equation describes the flow of heat in a homogeneous and isotropic medium, withux,y,z,tbeing the temperature at the pointx,y,zand timet. If the medium is not homogeneous and isotropic, thenαwould not be a fixed coefficient, and would instead depend onx,y,z the equation would also have a slightly different form. In the physics and engineering literature, it is common to use2to denote the Laplacian, rather than. In mathematics as well as in physics and engineering, it is common to useNewtons notationfor time derivatives, so thatudisplaystyle dot uis used to denoteut, so the equation can be written uΔudisplaystyle dot uDelta u Note also that the ability to use eitheror2to denote the Laplacian, without explicit reference to the spatial variables, is a reflection of the fact that the Laplacian is independent of the choice of coordinate system. In mathematical terms, one would say that the Laplacian is translationally and rotationally invariant. In fact, it is loosely speaking the simplest differential operator which has these symmetries. This can be taken as a significant and purely mathematical justification of the use of the Laplacian and of the heat equation in modeling any physical phenomena which are homogeneous and isotropic, of which heat diffusion is a principal example. Thediffusivity constant,α, is often not present in mathematical studies of the heat equation, while its value can be very important in engineering. This is not a major difference, for the following reason. Letube a function with Define a new functionvt,xutα,xdisplaystyle vt,xutalpha ,x. Then, according to thechain rule, one has Thus, there is a straightforward way of translating between solutions of the heat equation with a general value ofαand solutions of the heat equation withα 1. As such, for the sake of mathematical analysis, it is often sufficient to only consider the caseα 1. Sinceα0displaystyle alpha 0there is another option to define avdisplaystyle vsatisfyingtvΔvtextstyle frac partial partial tvDelta vas in  above by settingvt,xut,α12xdisplaystyle vt,xut,alpha 12x. Note that the two possible means of defining the new functionvdisplaystyle vdiscussed here amount, in physical terms, to changing the unit of measure of time or the unit of measure of length. The steady-state heat equation is by definition not dependent on time. In other words, it is assumed conditions exist such that This condition depends on the time constant and the amount of time passed since boundary conditions have been imposed. Thus, the condition is fulfilled in situations in which thetime equilibrium constant is fast enoughthat the more complex time-dependent heat equation can be approximated by the steady-state case. Equivalently, the steady-state condition exists for all cases in whichenough time has passedthat the thermal fielduno longer evolves in time. In the steady-state case, a spatial thermal gradient may or may not exist, but if it does, it does not change in time. This equation therefore describes the end result in all thermal problems in which a source is switched on for example, an engine started in an automobile, and enough time has passed for all permanent temperature gradients to establish themselves in space, after which these spatial gradients no longer change in time as again, with an automobile in which the engine has been running for long enough. The other trivial solution is for all spatial temperature gradients to disappear as well, in which case the temperature become uniform in space, as well. The equation is much simpler and can help to understand better the physics of the materials without focusing on the dynamic of the heat transport process. It is widely used for simple engineering problems assuming there is equilibrium of the temperature fields and heat transport, with time. Steady-state condition The steady-state heat equation for a volume that contains a heat source the inhomogeneous case, is thePoissons equation whereuis thetemperature,kis thethermal conductivityandqis the rate of heat generation per unit volume. Inelectrostatics, this is equivalent to the case where the space under consideration contains an electrical charge. The steady-state heat equation without a heat source within the volume the homogeneous case is the equation in electrostatics for a volume of free space that does not contain a charge. It is described byLaplaces equation Informally, the Laplacian operatorgives the difference between the average value of a function in the neighborhood of a point, and its value at that point. Thus, ifuis the temperature,uconveys if and by how much the material surrounding each point is hotter or colder, on the average, than the material at that point. By thesecond law of thermodynamics, heat will flow from hotter bodies to adjacent colder bodies, in proportion to the difference of temperature and of thethermal conductivityof the material between them. When heat flows into respectively, out of a material, its temperature increases respectively, decreases, in proportion to the amount of heat divided by the amount mass of material, with aproportionality factorcalled thespecific heat capacityof the material. By the combination of these observations, the heat equation says the rateudisplaystyle dot uat which the material at a point will heat up or cool down is proportional to how much hotter or cooler the surrounding material is. The coefficientαin the equation takes into account the thermal conductivity, specific heat, anddensityof the material. The first half of the above physical thinking can be put into a mathematical form. The key is that, for any fixedx, one has whereuxris the single-variable function denoting theaverage valueofuover the surface of the sphere of radiusrcentered atx it can be defined by in whichωn 1denotes the surface area of the unit ball inn-dimensional Euclidean space. This formalizes the above statement that the value ofuat a pointxmeasures the difference between the value ofuxand the value ofuat points nearby tox, in the sense that the latter is encoded by the values ofuxrfor small positive values ofr. Following this observation, one may interpret the heat equation as imposing aninfinitesimal averagingof a function. Given a solution of the heat equation, the value ofux,t τfor a small positive value ofτmay be approximated as12ntimes the average value of the functionu,tover a sphere of very small radius centered atx. The heat equation implies that peaks local maxima ofudisplaystyle uwill be gradually eroded down, while depressions local minima will be filled in. The value at some point will remain stable only as long as it is equal to the average value in its immediate surroundings. In particular, if the values in a neighborhood are very close to a linear functionAxByCzDdisplaystyle AxByCzD, then the value at the center of that neighborhood will not be changing at that time that is, the derivativeudisplaystyle dot uwill be zero. A more subtle consequence is themaximum principle, that says that the maximum value ofudisplaystyle uin any regionRdisplaystyle Rof the medium will not exceed the maximum value that previously occurred inRdisplaystyle R, unless it is on the boundary ofRdisplaystyle R. That is, the maximum temperature in a regionRdisplaystyle Rcan increase only if heat comes in from outsideRdisplaystyle R. This is a property ofparabolic partial differential equationsand is not difficult to prove mathematically see below. Another interesting property is that even ifudisplaystyle uinitially has a sharp jump discontinuity of value across some surface inside the medium, the jump is immediately smoothed out by a momentary, infinitesimally short but infinitely large rate of flow of heat through that surface. For example, if two isolated bodies, initially at uniform but different temperaturesu0displaystyle u_0andu1displaystyle u_1, are made to touch each other, the temperature at the point of contact will immediately assume some intermediate value, and a zone will develop around that point whereudisplaystyle uwill gradually vary betweenu0displaystyle u_0andu1displaystyle u_1. If a certain amount of heat is suddenly applied to a point in the medium, it will spread out in all directions in the form of adiffusion wave. Unlike theelasticandelectromagnetic waves, the speed of a diffusion wave drops with time as it spreads over a larger region, the temperature gradient decreases, and therefore the heat flow decreases too. For heat flow, the heat equation follows from the physical laws ofconduction of heatandconservation of energyCannon 1984. ByFouriers lawfor an isotropic medium, the rate of flow of heat energy per unit area through a surface is proportional to the negative temperature gradient across it wherekdisplaystyle kis thethermal conductivityof the material,uux,tdisplaystyle uumathbf x ,tis the temperature, andqqx,tdisplaystyle mathbf q mathbf q mathbf x ,tis avectorfield that represents the magnitude and direction of the heat flow at the pointxdisplaystyle mathbf x of space and timetdisplaystyle t. If the medium is a thin rod of uniform section and material, the positionxis a single coordinate and the heat flowqqt,xdisplaystyle qqt,xtowardsxdisplaystyle xis ascalar field. The equation becomes LetQQx,tdisplaystyle QQx,tbe theinternal energyheat per unit volume of the bar at each point and time. The rate of change in heat per unit volume in the material,Qtdisplaystyle partial Qpartial t, is proportional to the rate of change of its temperature,utdisplaystyle partial upartial t. That is, wherecdisplaystyle cis the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, in case of a gas andρdisplaystyle rho is the density mass per unit volume of the material. This derivation assumes that the material has constant mass density and heat capacity through space as well as time. Applying the law of conservation of energy to a small element of the medium centred atxdisplaystyle x, one concludes that the rate at which heat changes at a given pointxdisplaystyle xis equal to the derivative of the heat flow at that point the difference between the heat flows either side of the particle. That is, From the above equations it follows that which is the heat equation in one dimension, with diffusivity coefficient This quantity is called thethermal diffusivityof the medium. An additional term may be introduced into the equation to account for radiative loss of heat. According to theStefanBoltzmann law, this term isμu4v4displaystyle mu leftu4-v4right, wherevvx,tdisplaystyle vvx,tis the temperature of the surroundings, andμdisplaystyle mu is a coefficient that depends on theStefan-Boltzmann constantand theemissivityof the material. The rate of change in internal energy becomes and the equation for the evolution ofudisplaystyle ubecomes Note that the state equation, given by thefirst law of thermodynamicsi.e. conservation of energy, is written in the following form assuming no mass transfer or radiation. This form is more general and particularly useful to recognize which property e.g.cporρdisplaystyle rho  influences which term. whereqVdisplaystyle dot q_Vis the volumetric heat source. In general, the study of heat conduction is based on several principles. Heat flow is a form ofenergyflow, and as such it is meaningful to speak of the time rate of flow of heat into a region of space. Putting these equations together gives the general equation of heat flow Remarks In the special cases of propagation of heat in anisotropicandhomogeneousmedium in a 3-dimensionalspace, this equation is where The heat equation is a consequence of Fouriers law of conduction seeheat conduction. If the medium is not the whole space, in order to solve the heat equation uniquely we also need to specifyboundary conditionsforu. To determine uniqueness of solutions in the whole space it is necessary to assume additional conditions, for example an exponential bound on the growth of solutions1or a sign condition nonnegative solutions are unique by a result ofDavid Widder.2 Solutions of the heat equation are characterized by a gradual smoothing of the initial temperature distribution by the flow ofheatfrom warmer to colder areas of an object. Generally, many different states and starting conditions will tend toward the same stableequilibrium. As a consequence, to reverse the solution and conclude something about earlier times or initial conditions from the present heat distribution is very inaccurate except over the shortest of time periods. The heat equation is the prototypical example of aparabolic partial differential equation. Using theLaplace operator, the heat equation can be simplified, and generalized to similar equations over spaces of arbitrary number of dimensions, as where the Laplace operator, Δ or 2, the divergence of the gradient, is taken in the spatial variables. The heat equation governs heat diffusion, as well as other diffusive processes, such asparticle diffusionor the propagation ofaction potentialin nerve cells. Although they are not diffusive in nature, some quantum mechanics problems are also governed by a mathematical analog of the heat equation see below. It also can be used to model some phenomena arising infinance, like theBlackScholesor theOrnstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The equation, and various non-linear analogues, has also been used in image analysis. The heat equation is, technically, in violation ofspecial relativity, because its solutions involve instantaneous propagation of a disturbance. The part of the disturbance outside the forwardlight conecan usually be safely neglected, but if it is necessary to develop a reasonable speed for the transmission of heat, ahyperbolic problemshould be considered instead  like a partial differential equation involving a second-order time derivative. Some models of nonlinear heat conduction which are also parabolic equations have solutions with finite heat transmission speed.34 The functionuabove represents temperature of a body. Alternatively, it is sometimes convenient to change units and representuas the heat density of a medium. Since heat density is proportional to temperature in a homogeneous medium, the heat equation is still obeyed in the new units. Suppose that a body obeys the heat equation and, in addition, generates its own heat per unit volume e.g., in wattslitre - WL at a rate given by a known functionqvarying in space and time.5Then the heat per unit volumeusatisfies an equation For example, a tungsten light bulb filament generates heat, so it would have a positive nonzero value forqwhen turned on. While the light is turned off, the value ofqfor the tungsten filament would be zero. The following solution technique for the heat equation was proposed byJoseph Fourierin his treatiseThéorie analytique de la chaleur, published in 1822. Consider the heat equation for one space variable. This could be used to model heat conduction in a rod. The equation is whereuux,t is a function of two variablesxandt. Here We assume the initial condition where the functionfis given, and the boundary conditions Let us attempt to find a solution of 1 that is not identically zero satisfying the boundary conditions 3 but with the following propertyuis a product in which the dependence ofuonx,tis separated, that is This solution technique is calledseparation of variables. Substitutinguback into equation 1, Since the right hand side depends only onxand the left hand side only ont, both sides are equal to some constant value λ. Thus and We will now show that nontrivial solutions for 6 for values ofλ 0 cannot occur This solves the heat equation in the special case that the dependence ofuhas the special form 4. In general, the sum of solutions to 1 that satisfy the boundary conditions 3 also satisfies 1 and 3. We can show that the solution to 1, 2 and 3 is given by where The solution technique used above can be greatly extended to many other types of equations. The idea is that the operatoruxxwith the zero boundary conditions can be represented in terms of itseigenfunctions. This leads naturally to one of the basic ideas of thespectral theoryof linearself-adjoint operators. Consider thelinear operatorΔuuxx. The infinite sequence of functions forn 1 are eigenfunctions of Δ. Indeed, Moreover, any eigenfunctionfof Δ with the boundary conditionsf0 fL  0 is of the formenfor somen 1. The functionsenforn 1 form anorthonormalsequence with respect to a certaininner producton the space of real-valued functions on 0,L. This means Finally, the sequence ennNspans a dense linear subspace ofL20,L. This shows that in effect we havediagonalizedthe operator Δ. Solutions of the heat equations satisfy a mean-value property analogous to themean-value properties of harmonic functions, solutions of though a bit more complicated. Precisely, ifusolves and then whereEλis aheat-ball, that is a super-level set of the fundamental solution of the heat equation Notice that asλ  so the above formula holds for any x,t in the open set domu forλlarge enough.6 Afundamental solutionof the heat equation is a solution that corresponds to the initial condition of an initial point source of heat at a known position. These can be used to find a general solution of the heat equation over certain domains see, for instance, Evans 2010. In one variable, theGreens functionis a solution of the initial value problem byDuhamels principle, equivalent to the definition of Greens function as one with a delta function as solution to the first equation whereδdisplaystyle delta is theDirac delta function. The fundamental solution to this problem is given by theheat kernel One can obtain the general solution of the one variable heat equation with initial conditionux, 0 gx for   0, and in particular, being smooth, it satisfies the homogeneous Neumann boundary conditionsux0,t  0. TheGreens function numberof this solution is X20. Comment. This solution is theconvolutionwith respect to the variabletof and the functionht. Since Φx,t is the fundamental solution of the functionψx,t is also a solution of the same heat equation, and so isuψh, thanks to general properties of the convolution with respect to differentiation. Moreover, so that, by general facts aboutapproximation to the identity,ψx,  hhasx 0 in various senses, according to the specifich. For instance, ifhis assumed continuous onRwith support in 0,  thenψx,  hconverges uniformly on compacta tohasx 0, meaning thatux,t is continuous on0,   0, withu0,t ht. Comment. This solution is the convolution inR2, that is with respect to both the variablesxandt, of the fundamental solution and the functionfx,t, both meant as defined on the wholeR2and identically 0 for allt 0. One verifies that which expressed in the language of distributions becomes where the distribution δ is theDiracs delta function, that is the evaluation at 0. Comment. This solution is obtained from the preceding formula as applied to the datafx,t suitably extended toR 0,, so as to be an odd function of the variablex, that is, lettingfx,t  fx,t for allxandt. Correspondingly, the solution of the inhomogeneous problem on , is an odd function with respect to the variablexfor all values oft, and in particular it satisfies the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditionsu0,t  0.

Since the heat equation is linear, solutions of other combinations of boundary conditions, inhomogeneous term, and initial conditions can be found by taking an appropriatelinear combinationof the above Greens function solutions. For example, to solve letuwvwherewandvsolve the problems Similarly, to solve letuwvrwherew,v, andrsolve the problems As the prototypicalparabolic partial differential equation, the heat equation is among the most widely studied topics inpure mathematics, and its analysis is regarded as fundamental to the broader field ofpartial differential equations. The heat equation can also be considered onRiemannian manifolds, leading to many geometric applications. Following work ofSubbaramiah MinakshisundaramandÅke Pleijel, the heat equation is closely related withspectral geometry. A seminalnonlinear variant of the heat equationwas introduced todifferential geometrybyJames EellsandJoseph Sampsonin 1964, inspiring the introduction of theRicci flowbyRichard Hamiltonin 1982 and culminating in the proof of thePoincaré conjecturebyGrigori Perelmanin 2003. Certain solutions of the heat equation known asheat kernelsprovide subtle information about the region on which they are defined, as exemplified through their application to theAtiyahSinger index theorem.8 The heat equation, along with variants thereof, is also important in many fields of science andapplied mathematics. Inprobability theory, the heat equation is connected with the study ofrandom walksandBrownian motionvia theFokkerPlanck equation. TheBlackScholes equationoffinancial mathematicsis a small variant of the heat equation, and theSchrödinger equationofquantum mechanicscan be regarded as a heat equation inimaginary time. Inimage analysis, the heat equation is sometimes used to resolve pixelation and toidentify edges. FollowingRobert RichtmyerandJohn von Neumanns introduction of artificial viscosity methods, solutions of heat equations have been useful in the mathematical formulation ofhydrodynamical shocks. Solutions of the heat equation have also been given much attention in thenumerical analysisliterature, beginning in the 1950s with work of Jim Douglas, D.W. Peaceman, and Henry Rachford Jr. One can model particlediffusionby an equation involving either In either case, one uses the heat equation or BothcandPare functions of position and time.Dis the diffusion coefficient that controls the speed of the diffusive process, and is typically expressed in meters squared over second.

With a simple division, theSchrödinger equationfor a single particle ofmassmin the absence of any applied force field can be rewritten in the following way whereiis theimaginary unit,ħis thereduced Planck constant, andψis thewave functionof the particle. This equation is formally similar to the particle diffusion equation, which one obtains through the following transformation Applying this transformation to the expressions of the Green functions determined in the case of particle diffusion yields the Green functions of theSchrödinger equation, which in turn can be used to obtain thewave functionat any time through an integral on thewave functionatt 0 with Remark this analogy between quantum mechanics and diffusion is a purely formal one. Physically, the evolution of thewave functionsatisfyingSchrödingers equationmight have an origin other than diffusioncitation needed. A direct practical application of the heat equation, in conjunction withFourier theory, in spherical coordinates, is the prediction of thermal transfer profiles and the measurement of thethermal diffusivityinpolymersUnsworth andDuarte. This dual theoretical-experimental method is applicable to rubber, various other polymeric materials of practical interest, and microfluids. These authors derived an expression for the temperature at the center of a sphereTC whereT0is the initial temperature of the sphere andTSthe temperature at the surface of the sphere, of radiusL. This equation has also found applications in protein energy transfer and thermal modeling in biophysics. The heat equation arises in anumber of phenomenaand is often used infinancial mathematicsin themodelingofoptions. TheBlackScholesoption pricing modelsdifferential equationcan be transformed into the heat equation allowing relatively easy solutions from a familiar body of mathematics. Many of the extensions to the simple option models do not have closed form solutions and thus must be solved numerically to obtain a modeled option price. The equation describing pressure diffusion in a porous medium is identical in form with the heat equation.Diffusionproblems dealing withDirichlet,NeumannandRobin boundary conditionshave closed form analytic solutions Thambynayagam 2011. The heat equation is also widely used in image analysis Perona  Malik 1990 and inmachine learningas the driving theory behindscale-spaceorgraph Laplacianmethods. The heat equation can be efficiently solved numerically using the implicitCrankNicolson methodof Crank  Nicolson 1947. This method can be extended to many of the models with no closed form solution, see for instance Wilmott, Howison  Dewynne 1995. An abstract form of heat equation onmanifoldsprovides a major approach to theAtiyahSinger index theorem, and has led to much further work on heat equations inRiemannian geometry."
https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/de/theheatequation.aspx,Differential Equations - The Heat Equation,"In this section we will do a partial derivation of the heat equation that can be solved to give the temperature in a one dimensional bar of length L. In addition, we give several possible boundary conditions that can be used in this situation. We also define the Laplacian in this section and give a version of the heat equation for two or three dimensional situations.","Before we get into actually solving partial differential equations and before we even start discussing the method of separation of variables we want to spend a little bit of time talking about the two main partial differential equations that well be solving later on in the chapter. Well look at the first one in this section and the second one in the next section. The first partial differential equation that well be looking at once we get started with solving will be the heat equation, which governs the temperature distribution in an object. We are going to give several forms of the heat equation for reference purposes, but we will only be really solving one of them. We will start out by considering the temperature in a 1-D bar of length L. What this means is that we are going to assume that the bar starts off at x  0 and ends when we reach x  L. We are also going to so assume that at any location, x the temperature will be constant at every point in the cross section at that x. In other words, temperature will only vary in x and we can hence consider the bar to be a 1-D bar. Note that with this assumption the actual shape of the cross section i.e.circular, rectangular,etc. doesnt matter. Note that the 1-D assumption is actually not all that bad of an assumption as it might seem at first glance. If we assume that the lateral surface of the bar is perfectly insulated i.e.no heat can flow through the lateral surface then the only way heat can enter or leave the bar as at either end. This means that heat can only flow from left to right or right to left and thus creating a 1-D temperature distribution. The assumption of the lateral surfaces being perfectly insulated is of course impossible, but it is possible to put enough insulation on the lateral surfaces that there will be very little heat flow through them and so, at least for a time, we can consider the lateral surfaces to be perfectly insulated. Okay, lets now get some definitions out of the way before we write down the first form of the heat equation. We should probably make a couple of comments about some of these quantities before proceeding. The specific heat, cleft x right  0, of a material is the amount of heat energy that it takes to raise one unit of mass of the material by one unit of temperature. As indicated we are going to assume, at least initially, that the specific heat may not be uniform throughout the bar. Note as well that in practice the specific heat depends upon the temperature. However, this will generally only be an issue for large temperature differences which in turn depends on the material the bar is made out of and so were going to assume for the purposes of this discussion that the temperature differences are not large enough to affect our solution. The mass density, rho left x right, is the mass per unit volume of the material. As with the specific heat were going to initially assume that the mass density may not be uniform throughout the bar. The heat flux, varphi left x,t right, is the amount of thermal energy that flows to the right per unit surface area per unit time. The flows to the right bit simply tells us that if varphi left x,t right  0 for some x and t then the heat is flowing to the right at that point and time. Likewise, if varphi left x,t right  0 then heat energy is being added to the system at that location and time and if Qleft x,t right  0 is thethermal conductivityof the material and measures the ability of a given material to conduct heat. The better a material can conduct heat the larger K_0left x right will be. As noted the thermal conductivity can vary with the location in the bar. Also, much like the specific heat the thermal conductivity can vary with temperature, but we will assume that the total temperature change is not so great that this will be an issue and so we will assume for the purposes here that the thermal conductivity will not vary with temperature. Fouriers law does a very good job of modeling what we know to be true about heat flow. First, we know that if the temperature in a region is constant,i.e.fracpartial upartial x  0, then there is no heat flow. Next, we know that if there is a temperature difference in a region we know the heat will flow from the hot portion to the cold portion of the region. For example, if it is hotter to the right then we know that the heat should flow to the left. When it is hotter to the right then we also know that fracpartial upartial x  0 i.e.the temperature increases as we move to the right and so well have varphi  0 and heat will flow to the right as it should. Finally, the greater the temperature difference in a region i.e.the larger fracpartial upartial x is then the greater the heat flow. So, if we plug Fouriers law into eqrefeqeq1, we get the following form of the heat equation, Note that we factored the minus sign out of the derivative to cancel against the minus sign that was already there. We cannot however, factor the thermal conductivity out of the derivative since it is a function of x and the derivative is with respect to x. Solving eqrefeqeq2 is quite difficult due to the non uniform nature of the thermal properties and the mass density. So, lets now assume that these properties are all constant,i.e., where c, rho  and K_0 are now all fixed quantities. In this case we generally say that the material in the bar isuniform. Under these assumptions the heat equation becomes, For a final simplification to the heat equation lets divide both sides by crho  and define thethermal diffusivityto be, The heat equation is then, To most people this is what they mean when they talk about the heat equation and in fact it will be the equation that well be solving. Well, actually well be solving eqrefeqeq4 with no external sources,i.e.Qleft x,t right  0, but well be considering this form when we start discussing separation of variables in a couple of sections. Well only drop the sources term when we actually start solving the heat equation. Now that weve got the 1-D heat equation taken care of we need to move into the initial and boundary conditions well also need in order to solve the problem. If you go back to any of our solutions of ordinary differential equations that weve done in previous sections you can see that the number of conditions required always matched the highest order of the derivative in the equation. In partial differential equations the same idea holds except now we have to pay attention to the variable were differentiating with respect to as well. So, for the heat equation weve got a first order time derivative and so well need one initial condition and a second order spatial derivative and so well need two boundary conditions. The initial condition that well use here is, and we dont really need to say much about it here other than to note that this just tells us what the initial temperature distribution in the bar is. The boundary conditions will tell us something about what the temperature andor heat flow is doing at the boundaries of the bar. There are four of them that are fairly common boundary conditions. The first type of boundary conditions that we can have would be theprescribed temperatureboundary conditions, also calledDirichlet conditions. The prescribed temperature boundary conditions are, The next type of boundary conditions areprescribed heat flux, also calledNeumann conditions. Using Fouriers law these can be written as, If either of the boundaries areperfectly insulated,i.e.there is no heat flow out of them then these boundary conditions reduce to, and note that we will often just call these particular boundary conditionsinsulatedboundaries and drop the perfectly part. The third type of boundary conditions useNewtons law of coolingand are sometimes calledRobins conditions. These are usually used when the bar is in a moving fluid and note we can consider air to be a fluid for this purpose. Here are the equations for this kind of boundary condition. where H is a positive quantity that is experimentally determined and g_1left t right and g_2left t right give the temperature of the surrounding fluid at the respective boundaries. Note that the two conditions do vary slightly depending on which boundary we are at. At x  0 we have a minus sign on the right side while we dont at x  L. To see why this is lets first assume that at x  0 we have uleft 0,t right  g_1left t right. In other words, the bar is hotter than the surrounding fluid and so at x  0 the heat flow as given by the left side of the equation must be to the left, or negative since the heat will flow from the hotter bar into the cooler surrounding liquid. If the heat flow is negative then we need to have a minus sign on the right side of the equation to make sure that it has the proper sign. If the bar is cooler than the surrounding fluid at x  0,i.e.uleft 0,t right  g_2left t right. In this case the heat flow must be to the right, or be positive, and so in this case we cant have a minus sign. Finally, well again leave it to you to verify that we cant have the minus sign at x  L is the bar is cooler than the surrounding fluid as well. Note that we are not actually going to be looking at any of these kinds of boundary conditions here. These types of boundary conditions tend to lead to boundary value problems such asExample 5in the Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions section of the previous chapter. As we saw in that example it is often very difficult to get our hands on the eigenvalues and as well eventually see we will need them. It is important to note at this point that we can also mix and match these boundary conditions so to speak. There is nothing wrong with having a prescribed temperature at one boundary and a prescribed flux at the other boundary for example so dont always expect the same boundary condition to show up at both ends. This warning is more important that it might seem at this point because once we get into solving the heat equation we are going to have the same kind of condition on each end to simplify the problem somewhat. The final type of boundary conditions that well need here areperiodicboundary conditions. Periodic boundary conditions are, Note that for these kinds of boundary conditions the left boundary tends to be x  - L instead of x  0 as we were using in the previous types of boundary conditions. The periodic boundary conditions will arise very naturally from a couple of particular geometries that well be looking at down the road. We will now close out this section with a quick look at the 2-D and 3-D version of the heat equation. However, before we jump into that we need to introduce a little bit of notation first. Thedeloperator is defined to be, depending on whether we are in 2 or 3 dimensions. Think of the del operator as a function that takes functions as arguments instead of numbers as were used to. Whatever function we plug into the operator gets put into the partial derivatives. So, for example in 3-D we would have, This of course is also the gradient of the function fleft x,y,z right. The del operator also allows us to quickly write down the divergence of a function. So, again using 3-D as an example the divergence of fleft x,y,z right can be written as the dot product of the del operator and the function. Or, Finally, we will also see the following show up in our work, This is usually denoted as, and is called theLaplacian. The 2-D version of course simply doesnt have the third term. Okay, we can now look into the 2-D and 3-D version of the heat equation and where ever the del operator and or Laplacian appears assume that it is the appropriate dimensional version. The higher dimensional version of eqrefeqeq1 is, and note that the specific heat, c, and mass density, rho , are may not be uniform and so may be functions of the spatial variables. Likewise, the external sources term, Q, may also be a function of both the spatial variables and time. Next, the higher dimensional version of Fouriers law is, where the thermal conductivity, K_0, is again assumed to be a function of the spatial variables. If we plug this into eqrefeqeq5 we get the heat equation for a non uniform bar i.e.the thermal properties may be functions of the spatial variables with external sourcessinks, If we now assume that the specific heat, mass density and thermal conductivity are constant i.e.the bar is uniform the heat equation becomes, where we divided both sides by crho  to get the thermal diffusivity, k in front of the Laplacian. The initial condition for the 2-D or 3-D heat equation is, depending upon the dimension were in. The prescribed temperature boundary condition becomes, where left x,y right or left x,y,z right, depending upon the dimension were in, will range over the portion of the boundary in which we are prescribing the temperature. The prescribed heat flux condition becomes, where the left side is only being evaluated at points along the boundary and vec n is the outward unit normal on the surface. Newtons law of cooling will become, where H is a positive quantity that is experimentally determine, u_B is the temperature of the fluid at the boundary and again it is assumed that this is only being evaluated at points along the boundary. We dont have periodic boundary conditions here as they will only arise from specific 1D geometries. We should probably also acknowledge at this point that well not actually be solving eqrefeqeq6 at any point, but we will be solving a special case of it in theLaplaces Equationsection."

We assume that the bar is perfectly insulated except possibly at its endpoints, and that the temperature is constant on each cross section and therefore depends only on x and t. We also assume that the thermal properties of the bar are independent of x and t. In this case, it can be shown that the temperature u  ux, t at time t at a point x units from the origin satisfies the partial differential equation u_ta2u_xx,quad 00,nonumber  where a is a positive constant determined by the thermal properties. This is theheat equation. To determine u, we must specify the temperature at every point in the bar when t0, say ux,0fx,quad 0le xle L. nonumber  We call this theinitialcondition. We must also specifyboundary conditionsthat u must satisfy at the ends of the bar for all t0. Well call this problem aninitial-boundary value problem. We begin with the boundary conditions u0,tuL,t0, and write the initial-boundary value problem as labeleq12.1.1 beginarraycu_ta2u_xx,quad 00,4ptu0,t0,quad uL,t0,quad t0,4ptux,0fx,quad 0leq xleq L.endarray  Our method of solving this problem is calledseparation of variablesnot to be confused with method of separation of variables used in Section 2.2 for solving ordinary differential equations. We begin by looking for functions of the form vx,tXxTt nonumber  that are not identically zero and satisfy v_ta2v_xx,quad v0,t0,quad vL,t0 nonumber  for all x,t. Since v_tXT quad textand quad v_xxXT, nonumber  v_ta2v_xx if and only if XTa2XT, nonumber  which we rewrite as Tover a2TXover X. nonumber  Since the expression on the left is independent of x while the one on the right is independent of t, this equation can hold for all x,t only if the two sides equal the same constant, which we call aseparation constant, and write it as -lambda thus, Xover XTover a2T-lambda. nonumber  This is equivalent to Xlambda X0 nonumber  and labeleq12.1.2 T-a2lambda T.  Since v0,tX0Tt0 and vL,tXLTt0 and we dont want T to be identically zero, X00 and XL0. Therefore lambda must be an eigenvalue of the boundary value problem labeleq12.1.3 Xlambda X0,quad X00,quad XL0,  and X must be a lambda-eigenfunction. From Theorem 11.1.2, the eigenvalues of Equation refeq12.1.3 are lambda_nn2pi2L2, with associated eigenfunctions X_nsinnpi xover L, quad n1,2,3,dots. nonumber  Substituting lambdan2pi2L2 into Equation refeq12.1.2 yields T-n2pi2a2L2T, nonumber  which has the solution T_ne-n2pi2a2tL2. nonumber  Now let v_nx,tX_nxT_nte-n2pi2a2tL2sinnpi xover L,quad n1,2,3,dots nonumber  Since v_nx,0sinnpi xover L, nonumber  v_n satisfies Equation refeq12.1.1 with fxsin npi xL. More generally, if alpha_1,dots,alpha_m are constants and u_mx,t sum_n1m alpha_ne-n2pi2a2tL2sinnpi xover L, nonumber  then u_m satisfies Equation refeq12.1.1 with fxsum_n1m alpha_nsinnpi xover L. nonumber  This motivates the next definition. Theformal solutionof the initial-boundary value problem labeleq12.1.4 beginarraycu_ta2u_xx,quad 00,4ptu0,t0,quad uL,t0,quad t0,4ptux,0fx,quad 0leq xleq Lendarray  is labeleq12.1.5 ux,tsum_n1infty alpha_ne-n2pi2a2tL2sinnpi xover L,  where Sxsum_n1infty alpha_nsinnpi xover L nonumber  is the Fourier sine series of f on 0,L that is, alpha_n dfrac2L int_0L fx sin dfracnpi xL ,dx. nonumber  We use the term formal solution in this definition because it is not in general true that the infinite series in Equation refeq12.1.5 actually satisfies all the requirements of the initial-boundary value problem Equation refeq12.1.4 when it does, we say that it is anactual solutionof Equation refeq12.1.4. Because of the negative exponentials in Equation refeq12.1.5, u converges for all x,t with t0. Since each term in Equation refeq12.1.5 satisfies the heat equation and the boundary conditions in Equation refeq12.1.4, u also has these properties if u_t and u_xx can be obtained by differentiating the series in Equation refeq12.1.5 term by term once with respect to t and twice with respect to x, for t0. However, it is not always legitimate to differentiate an infinite series term by term. The next theorem gives a useful sufficient condition for legitimacy of term by term differentiation of an infinite series. We omit the proof. A convergent infinite series Wzsum_n1infty w_nz nonumber  can be differentiated term by term on a closed interval z_1,z_2 to obtain Wzsum_n1infty w_nz nonumber  where the derivatives at zz_1 and zz_2 are one-sided provided that w_n is continuous on z_1,z_2 and w_nzle M_n,quad z_1le zle z_2,quad n1,2,3,dots, nonumber  where M_1, M_2, , M_n, , are constants such that the series sum_n1infty M_n converges. Theorem 12.1.2 , applied twice with zx and once with zt, shows that u_xx and u_t can be obtained by differentiating u term by term if t0 Exercise 12.1.54. Therefore u satisfies the heat equation and the boundary conditions in Equation refeq12.1.4 for t0. Therefore, since ux,0Sx for 0le xle L, u is an actual solution of Equation refeq12.1.4 if and only if Sxfx for 0le xle L. From Theorem 11.3.2, this is true if f is continuous and piecewise smooth on 0,L, and f0fL0. In this chapter well define formal solutions of several kinds of problems. When we ask you to solve such problems, we always mean that you should find a formal solution. Solve Equation refeq12.1.4 with fxxx2-3Lx2L2.

The line yx corresponds to t0. The other curves correspond to positive values of t. As t increases, the graphs approach the line u0.

We write labeleq12.1.10 ux,tvx,tqx,  where q is to be determined. Then u_tv_t quad textand quad u_xxv_xxqnonumber  so u satisfies Equation refeq12.1.9 if v satisfies beginarraycv_ta2v_xxa2qxhx,quad 00,4ptv0,tu_0-q0,quad vL,tu_L-qL,quad t0,4ptvx,0fx-qx,quad 0leq xleq L.endarraynonumber  This reduces to labeleq12.1.11 beginarraycv_ta2v_xx,quad 00,4ptv0,t0,quad vL,t0,quad t0,4ptvx,0fx-qx,quad 0leq xleq Lendarray  if a2qhx0,quad q0u_0,quad qLu_L.nonumber  We can obtain q by integrating q-ha2 twice and choosing the constants of integration so that q0u_0 and qLu_L. Then we can solve Equation refeq12.1.11 for v by separation of variables, and Equation refeq12.1.10 is the solution of Equation refeq12.1.9.

To be specific, consider the formal solution ux,tsum_n1infty alpha_ne-n2pi2a2tL2sinnpi xover L,nonumber  of Equation refeq12.1.4, where Sxsum_n1infty alpha_n sinnpi x over Lnonumber  is the Fourier sine series of f on 0,L. Consider the m-th partial sum labeleq12.1.12 u_mx,tsum_n1m alpha_ne-n2pi2a2tL2sinnpi xover L.  For several fixed values of t including t0, graph u_mx,t versus t. In some cases it may be useful to graph the curves corresponding to the various values of t on the same axes in other cases you may want to graph the various curves successively for increasing values of t, and create a primitive motion picture on your monitor. Repeat this experiment for several values of m, to compare how the results depend upon m for small and large values of t. However, keep in mind that the meanings of small and large in this case depend upon the constants a2 and L2. A good way to handle this is to rewrite Equation refeq12.1.12 as u_mx,tsum_n1m alpha_ne-n2tausinnpi xover L,nonumber  where labeleq12.1.13 taupi2a2tover L2,  and graph u_m versus x for selected values of tau. These comments also apply to the situations considered in Definitions 12.1.3 -12.1.5 , except that Equation refeq12.1.13 should be replaced by taupi2a2tover 4L2,nonumber  in Definitions 12.1.4 and 12.1.5 .

Ive been binging 3blue1brown recently and was watching his difeq playlist where he uses the heat equationproblem to explain partial differential equations. specificallythisvideo Im nearly confident I understand the premise behind the heat equation but feel free to give an in depth explanation if it helps, but theres one part that is puzzling me. Assuming the heat equation is a closed system which it is it shouldnt lose or gain heat correct. I wrote a quick 1 dimensional program that implements the heat equation and had it print out the total amount of heat in the rod. It never changes however it still approachesreaches the global average. Logically this makes sense because it shouldnt go anywhere, but how is this expressed in the equation? It seems weird to me that adding or subtracting a number from each node without taking or adding the same amount to another node would provide such a perfect answer? Thanks in advance!

For the heat equation partial_t-partial_x2ft,x0 defined on 0,Ttimes-infty,infty, to obtain uniqueness of the initial value problem, usually it is required to limit the growth of the potential solution at infinity, i.e. ft,xexpccdot x2. My question is, if we do not impose any such conditions, is uniqueness no longer valid? In particular, is there a well known example of a function ft,x that satisfies the heat equation on 0,Ttimes-infty,infty, f0,x0, but f is not identically zero? What if we relaxed the conditions a little bit, and only required that f satisfies the heat equation in 0,Ttimes-infty,infty and is continuous on 0,Ttimes-infty,infty, is there an example in this case? Tychonoff in his 1935 paperThéorèmes dunicité pour léquation de la chaleurproved uniqueness if the solutions are not too large, and gave an example to show that the solution is not unique in general.

It is regarding making the Julia code of 1D Heat equation faster. With this message, I have also attached the Julia source code. I had some ideas which I can implement but unsure of that. I have listed them below. I request everyone to enlighten me whether I am going in the right direction. Your ideas and suggestions are also most welcomed. 1 While defining the system matrix and matrix A, maybe I can use Staticarrays.jl instead of spdiagm. Is it possible? If yes, how can I implement it? 2 Searching for other optimizers instead of Ipopt. 3 Can I use Import Ipopt.optimizer instead of using the whole library in the code? Using whole library may occupy a lot more space and can also make the program slower to run. Thank you for your time and I hope to receive suggestions and ideas! I think you should profile the code to see where the bottlenecks are. Unless the execution is really quick, 3 is probably irrelevant. 1 may or may not make any difference. I dont know what the scope of your project is, butPDE constrained optimisationis a big topic with very elegant and useful algorithms to compute the gradients faster with so-called adjoint equations. Two recommendations first, carefully read and apply theperformance tips, particularly the admonition to avoid non-constant global variables. Second, please share your code as text wrapped in triple backticks so other users can easily read and copy-paste it seehere. I mean, this is just a generally inefficient algorithm for solving the heat equation. If youre really looking to speed it up, you might want to try starting with a more efficient algorithm, like writing it in Fourier space and just doing a diagonal solve. The suggestions for static arrays are unlikely to help due to the way JuMP constructs problems. From a purely JuMP perspective, the formulation looks okay. Given the formulation, what makes you think it is slow? Ipopt is pretty good for this sort of stuff. As Chris says, there are alternate algorithmic approaches that may be more efficient. Thank you for your message! How can I implement Staticarrays in my code? Can you please guide me through that? Thank you for your message. Actually it takes around 12-15 minutes to get the result and graphs after running this code. I need to reduce the program execution time and that is my task. Hello Chris. Thank you for your message. What specifically makes this inefficient? Is this the current Euler algorithm that is used in the code? Can you please help me how can I write this code using Fourier space and solving the diagonals? Please readPlease read make it easier to help youand provide your code as text that can be copy-pasted. Did you take a look at where the time is being spent? I guess most of the 12 minutes is inside Ipopt. You have 106 variables and constraints. If you continue to use Ipopt, you should try a more efficient linear solverhttpsgithub.comjump-devIpopt.jllinear-solvers I modified the program using StaticArrays, but it seems it is not making a significant impact on the speed. I am more convinced that I will have to change the Ipopt optimzer. Can you suggest efficient optimizers rather than Ipopt?

Closed8 years ago. Im trying to familiarize myself with usingMathematicasNDSolveto solve PDEs. Im using a simple one-dimensional heat equation as a start. The initial condition is a sine function and Im expecting a standing wave as a solution of the heat equation. For some reason, plotting the result gives an empty plot. Whats the problem here? Is the code causing the solution to be zero everywhere for all values ofx for all values oft? First, you should useSet notEqual forss  NDSolve..... Second,NDSolvegives a nested list of rules with-, so you need to extract the actual interpolating function withFirstandReplaceAll.

This may be a really stupid question, but hopefully someone will point out what ive been missingIve just started studying PDE and came across the classification of second order equations, for example inthispdf. It states that given second order equation au_xx2bu_xycu_yydu_xeu_yfu0 if b2-4ac0 then given equation is parabolic, then goes on to state that the heat equation u_t-u_xx0 is the most common example of a parabolic equation. Ive also seen the one dimensional heat equation as u_t-ku_xx0 with a non-negative constant k. My question is I dont see how this satisfies the parabolic condition. If ux,t is the solution, and we take t to be x in the general equation above and x to be y, then the coefficient 1 of u_t is e and -1 or -k is c. So b2-4ac4 or 4k which is zero only in the case that k is zero. How then is the heat equation parabolic? In this case xx and yt. So ak and bc0. So b2-4ac02-4k00 To subscribe to this RSS feed, copy and paste this URL into your RSS reader. Site design  logo  2025 Stack Exchange Incuser contributions licensed underCC BY-SA.rev 2025.1.23.21399"

Inspired by a question I askedhere, I am rethinking about a question Why heat equation is not time-reversible? I dont know too much about PDE and physics but I guess there should be some time arrow in mathematics. Consider the following initial value problem  begincases Omega x,t in mathbbR times 0,infty  ux,0  deltax  u_t - u_xx  0 endcases  The solution is given by  ux,t  frac1sqrt4 pi t exp Big frac-x24t Big  I remember from my undergraduate PDE course, it is different from elliptic equation which is time-reversible. If I substitute t mapsto -t and change the domain Omega to mathbbR times -infty,0, the above solution will not satisfy the PDE u_t - u_xx. I know that we may recall second law of thermodynamics, but it is a physical law, not a mathematical theorem or axioms. For a mathematical reason, there should be logical deduction from axioms to a structure that make heat equation different. What is the reason behind that? I also recall a second-order PDE on a domain Omega  Ax,y u_xx  2Bx,y u_xy  Cx,y u_yy  Wu,u_x,u_y,x,y  We say it is i parabolic if for all x,y in Omega, B2 - AC  0 ii hyperbolic if for all x,y in Omega, B2 - AC  0 iii elliptic if for all x,y in Omega, B2 - AC  0 is infinitely-differentiable because it is averaged by a Gaussian, and the Gaussian couldnt be more smooth. You shouldnt expect to be able to undo such a process. This is a diffusion equation, and the speed of propagation is, essentially, infinite, which makes it physically unrealistic. Even with added viscosity, the process is irreversible. If you solve the heat equation numerically, then you can ask how the solution at a point on the grid depends on time. As you begin to answer this question, you find yourself looking at the paths back to the initial data, through the numerical algorithm, which can be thought of as the density of paths that refer to the initial data. In the limit of large number of grid points, this begins to look like a central limit problem and, hence, the Gaussian weighting of the initial data. This is definitely not a process youd expect to reverse. Brownian motion can be used to look at this process of solution. Heat flow is a diffusion process, and the averaging should not be expeced to be reversible. Entropy is increasing. This is going to be more of a Why I think its not reversible than a rigorous argument Att  0, let the temperature for a 1-dimensional homogeneous medium be piece-wise constant T0,x  1forx  0. For any value of x, ast to infty,Tt,x to 2. Now, take any value oft  0, andTt,xwill not, as a function ofx, be identically equals 2. Numerically or analytically, you can run the heat diffusion equation backwards, to smaller values of t. But once you reacht  0, you will regain the original discontinuity atx  0. What doesT0 - epsilon,xlook like? I dont believe there is a reasonable answer to that. To subscribe to this RSS feed, copy and paste this URL into your RSS reader.

Ive ran across the idea that, besides simply writing partial differential equations in covariant form, they need to be hyperbolic with all characteristic speeds less than the speed of light. A straightforward generalization of the equations for a dissipative fluid to the relativistic case supposedly runs into trouble because of the presence of the heat equation fracpartial Tpartial t  kappa nabla2 T. In the actual relativistic theory this is generalized to something covariant like umunabla_mu T  kappagmunu-umu ununabla_munabla_nu T,  where  u  is a timelike vector this is only schematic, there are other terms. But the point is there is still a problem with this theory because this is a parabolic equation. Im wondering is there a way to see something clearly pathological like superluminal signals in the heat equation? This is a little unclear to me since the equation is not wave-like. If suppose you cant send signals faster than light what would be the problem with non-hyperbolic equations? What follows is certainly not a comprehensive answer addressing all of your concerns. It is an answer to the question is there a way to see something clearly pathological like superluminal signals in the heat equation? I would argue that yes, there is. The general solution to the initial value problem Tx,0  T_0x for the heat equation on the real line is beginalign Tx,t  int_-inftyinftydx, T_0xGx-x, t. endalign where G is the Greens function for the heat equation and is explicitly given by beginalign Gx,t  frace-x24kappa tsqrtpi 4kappa t. endalign Notice that if T_0x  deltax, namely if one were to provide a localized unit impulse of heat at the origin at t0, then for all later times, the temperature distribution would equal the Greens function which is why it is often called the impulse-response andor source function beginalign Tx,t  frace-x24kappa tsqrtpi 4kappa t, qquad t0. endalign But this is a Gaussian distribution over the real line which is nonzero everywhere for all t0. In other words, if you heat up a point on the real line at time t0, then for any t0, no matter how small, the entire line will have some nonzero temperature, even though it started at zero temperature everywhere except at the origin. This behavior allows for superluminal signaling. To see how this is so, notice that if you have a long rod from here to Proxima Centauri made of a material that precisely obeys the heat equation, and if you want to warn your ally stationed near Proxima Centauri of an impending alien attack, you just need to keep the rod cold until the moment you hear intel of an attack. At this moment, you can simply heat up the portion of the rod next to you, and she will instantly measure the portion of the rod next to her as being hotter. She can then immediately begin to prepare to defend her station. Thanks for contributing an answer to Physics Stack Exchange! Butavoid Use MathJax to format equations.MathJax reference.

Answering another question, coryan was so nice as to mention the methodusing heat equation to interpolate approximate a terrain surfacewhich Ive heard about and been eager to learn, or even find a parallel implementation? Could please coryan or anybody else point me to such an implementation, if its in public domain, or at least to explain a bit further how it is done. Not sure about heat eqautions, but the way that I solve this problem is viaTIN modelling. Check outHerbert Edelsbrunnersbook on the topic,Geometry and Topology for Mesh Generation. I would have it down as a must read. Also well worthwhile is Joeseph ORourkesComputational Geometry in Cwhich while more general does include worked examples and makes a useful cookbook. In terms of open source, check the followingCode Guru linkand have a look atPaul Bourkeswork. Well, the Wikipedia article he pointed to is a good start. Think about putting an ice cube in a glass of hot tea the first instant, the gradient between them is steep but heat crosses the gradient in proportion to the gradient, so it starts changing quickly, and then changes more slowly over time. Thats why its a parabolic partial differential equation the rate of change is changing, so you have ²t in there. So you evaluate the points, adjusting the terrain at each step, to smooth the process. Doing it in parallel is simply that you can hand each grid point and its adjacent values to a separate process for each step it doesnt depend on anything else.

https://levelup.gitconnected.com/solving-2d-heat-equation-numerically-using-python-3334004aa01a,Solving 2D Heat Equation Numerically using Python  Level Up Coding,How to solve heat equation numerically using Python,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in G. Nervadof Follow Level Up Coding -- 14 Listen Share When I was in college studying physics a few years ago, I remember there was a task to solve heat equation analytically for some simple problems. In the next semester we learned about numerical methods to solve some partial differential equations PDEs in general. Its really interesting to see how we could solve them numerically and visualize the solutions as a heat map, and its really cool pun intended. I also remember, in the previous semester we learned C programming language, so it was natural for us to solve PDEs numerically using C although some students were struggling with C and not with solving the PDE itself. If I had known how to code in Python back then, I wouldve used it instead of C I am not saying C is bad though. Here, I am going to show how we can solve 2D heat equation numerically and see how easy it is to translate the equations into Python code. Before we do the Python code, lets talk about the heat equation and finite-difference method. Heat equation is basically a partial differential equation, it is If we want to solve it in 2D Cartesian, we can write the heat equation above like this whereuis the quantity that we want to know,tis for temporal variable,xandyare for spatial variables, andαis diffusivity constant. So basically we want to find the solutionueverywhere inxandy, and over timet. Now lets see the finite-difference method FDM in a nutshell. Finite-difference method is a numerical method for solving differential equations by approximating derivative with finite differences. Remember that the definition of derivative is In finite-difference method, we approximate it and remove the limit. So, instead of using differential and limit symbol, we use delta symbol which is the finite difference. Note that this is oversimplified, because we have to use Taylor series expansion and derive it from there by assuming some terms to be sufficiently small, but we get the rough idea behind this method. In finite-difference method, we are going to discretize the spatial domain and the time intervalx,y, andt. We can write it like this As we can see,i,j, andkare the steps for each difference forx,y, andtrespectively. What we want is the solutionu, which is Note thatkis superscript to denote time step foru. We can write the heat equation above using finite-difference method like this If we arrange the equation above by taking Δx Δy, we get this final equation where We can use this stencil to remember the equation above look at subscriptsi,jfor spatial steps and superscriptkfor the time step We use explicit method to get the solution for the heat equation, so it will be numerically stable whenever Everything is ready. Now we can solve the original heat equation approximated by algebraic equation above, which is computer-friendly. For an exercise problem, lets suppose a thin square plate with the side of 50 unit length. The temperature everywhere inside the plate is originally 0 degree att 0, lets see the diagram below this is not realistic, but its good for exercise For our model, lets take Δx 1 andα 2.0. Now we can use Python code to solve this problem numerically to see the temperature everywhere denoted byiandj and over time denoted byk. Lets first import all of the necessary libraries, and then set up the boundary and initial conditions. Weve set up the initial and boundary conditions, lets write the calculation function based on finite-difference method that weve derived above. Lets prepare the plot function so we can visualize the solution for eachk as a heat map. We useMatplotliblibrary, its easy to use. One more thing that we need is to animate the result because we want to see the temperature points inside the plate change over time. So lets create the function to animate the solution. Now, were done! Lets see the complete code below and run it. Thats it! And heres the result Cool isnt it? By the way, you can try the code above using this Python Online Compilerhttpsrepl.itlanguagespython3, make sure you change themax_iter_timeto 50 before you run the code to make the iteration result faster. Okay, we have the code now, lets play with something more interesting, lets set all of the boundary conditions to 0, and then randomize the initial condition for the interior grid. And heres the result Python is relatively easy to learn for beginners compared to other programming languages. I would recommend to use Python for solving computational problems like weve done here, at least for prototyping because it has really powerful numerical and scientific libraries. The community is also growing bigger and bigger, and that can make things easier to Google when were stuck with it. Python may not be as fast as C or C, but using Python we can focus more on the problem solving itself rather than the language, of course we still need to know the Python syntax and its simple array manipulation to some degree, but once we get it, it will be really powerful.

Dokken As a first extension of the Poisson problem from the previous chapter, we consider the time-dependent heat equation, or the time-dependent diffusion equation. This is the natural extension of the Poisson equation describing the stationary distribution of heat in a body to a time-dependent problem. We will see that by discretizing time into small time intervals and applying standard time-stepping methods, we can solve the heat equation by solving a sequence of variational problems, much like the one we encountered for the Poisson equation. The model problem for the time-dependent PDE reads Hereuvaries with space and time, e.g.uux,y,tif the spatial domainOmegais two-dimensional. The source functionfand the boundary valuesu_Dmay also vary with space and time. The initial conditionu_0is a function of space only. A straightforward approach to solving time-dependent PDEs by the finite element method is to first discretize the time derivative by a finite difference approximation, which yields a sequence of stationary problems, and then turn each stationary problem into a variational formulation. We will let the superscriptndenote a quantity at timet_n, wherenis an integer counting time levels. For example,unmeansuat time leveln. The first step of a finite difference discretization in time consists of sampling the PDE at some time level, for instancet_n1 The time-derivative can be approximated by a difference quotient. For simplicity and stability reasons, we choose a simple backward difference whereDelta tis the time discretization parameter. Inserting the latter expression into our equation at time stepn1yields This is our time-discrete version of the heat equation. It is called abackward Euleror aimplicit Eulerdiscretization. We reorder the equation such that the left-hand side contains the terms with only the unknownun1and right-hand side contains only computed terms. The resulting equation is a sequence of stationary problems forun1, assumingunis known from the previous time step Givenu_0, we can solve foru0, u1, u2and so on. We then in turn use the finite element method. This means that we have to turn the equation into its weak formulation. We multiply by the test-function ofvin hatVand integrate second-order derivatives by parts. We now introduce the symboluforun1and we write the resulting weak formulation as where In addition to the variational problem to be solved in each time step, we also need to approximate the initial condition. This equation can also be turned into a variational problem with When solving this variational problemu0becomes theL2-projection of the given initial valueu_0into the finite element space. The alternative is to constructu0by just interpolating the initial valueu_0. We covered how to use interpolation in DOLFINx in themembrane chapter. We can use DOLFINx to either project or interpolate the initial condition. The most common choice is to use a projection, which computes an approximation tou_0. However, in some applications where we want to verify the code by reproducing exact solutions, one must use interpolation. In this chapter, we will use such a problem. previous A Gallery of finite element solvers next Diffusion of a Gaussian function By Jørgen S. Dokken  Copyright 2023. Last updated on Jan 13, 2025."

The heat equation  fracpartial upartial t  alpha nabla2 u  fx,t tag 1  Here,urepresents the temperature field,alphais the thermal diffusivity of the material,nabla2is the Laplacian operator, andfx,trepresents the sinksource term. I guess that it would depends on what kind of sinksource function would be to be able to consider it linear and time invariant. My physical intuition is that it should be linear similar to how heat source can add up, but maybe of we put heat source as a function of the temperature itself it might break linearity? Not sure about time invariant too. An equation alone does not describe a system. You can define a linear system from it if you consider the heat equation asdefininga systemhwhereumathbf x, t  hfmathbf x, t tag aand the dynamics ofumathbf x, tconform to your 1, which I repeat here fracpartialpartial t umathbf x, t  alpha nabla2 umathbf x, t  fmathbf x,t tag b  The important thing that Ive done here is to definefmathbf x,tas an input to your system -- this means that you dont take its dependency onmathbf xortinto account when determining ifhis linear. This leaves with the operations onu.frac partialpartial tis a linear operation, and so isnabla2-- so the system is linear. Note that what the isnota finite-state system.uis the system state, but even if its describing a finite-sized chunk of stuff, the states are continuous. This means that even if you did find a closed-form Laplace-domain transfer function fromftomathbf uit would not be a ratio of polynomials ins. So dont expect nice closed-form solutions. But do expect that there are opportunities to use Fourier analysis to solve problems involving heat flow. It is why Fourier invented his transform in the first place, after all.

https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/424357,Why the heat equation doesnt work with NDSolve? - Online Technical Discussion GroupsWolfram Community,Wolfram Community forum discussion about Why the heat equation doesnt work with NDSolve?. Stay on top of important topics and build connections by joining Wolfram Community groups relevant to your interests.,"Hi. I want to find a numerical solution for the heat equation. I use Mathematica 10.0. The code that I use to find the solution is this The problem is that, when I click on evaluate notebook, the program runs for few seconds and then it stops without error messagges, but only with a beep sound. So I click on Help  Why the Beep?... and this is the message that appears on the screen The kernel Local has quit exited during the course of an evaluation. What does it mean? Please help me, I dont know how to solve this problem. Thanks for your suggestions. Jo R Thank you Bruce Miller. I will do that. I opened the task manager while kernel was running and i saw that the memory occupied was 2GB max. So it isnt the problem. Its very strange. However thank you for your help. Registering or not registering should have nothing to do with a crash. Since this is repeatable for you, try catching a dump of it. This will probably be too big to send by email. It can be uploaded viahttpupload.wolfram.com. For the Recipient field, put supportwolfram.com. In the Additional notes, mention this discussion number, 424357. It would be helpful if you sent the output from runningsysteminfoin a command-prompt window via Start - Programs - Accessories, or Start - Run - cmd.exe This also is long. Copy and paste it into return email or put it into a file and attach the file. It looks like Ive tried to solve the problem by resetting Mathematica, but it hasnt worked. However, Im thinking that I activated the software with product key, but I didnt registered it on the wolframs website. Would it be the cause of the problem? I doubt that is the problem. The kernel can exit if out of memory. I would think 6GB was enough, but the least I have on a system is 8GB on my laptop. For simple equations it works perfectly. Ive tried also to solve ordinary differential equations and it works without any problem. The problem appears when I try to solve more complex equations, like partial differential equations. I dont know what to do, Im spending a lot of time only to understand what kind of problem it is. This is unusual. If resetting doesnt work, you might want to contact tech support. Or . . . maybe someone else on the forum has an insight. One more thing, Jo. I notice this is the 2nd post in which you describe an unexpected kernel exit. Does anything work? For example, If you start Mathematica fresh and then input x  2, do you get the same problem? If so, you might read the information on resetting preferencesResetting Mathematica similar post ishttpcommunity.wolfram.comgroups-mt424530- moderator Hi David Keith. Thank you for the answer. I post the notebook here. It is possible that its an hardware problem? I have an ASUS F552EP with - microprocessor AMD quad-core 2.0 GHz - 6 GB RAM The OS is Windows 7 64-bit. Hi Jo -- this notebook works OK for me. I suggest resetting Mathematica. The code you posted works for me. Try running it in a fresh kernel. If it still doesnt work, I suggest you post the notebook."

Before sharing sensitive information, make sure youre on a federal government site. The site is secure.Thehttpsensures that you are connecting to the official website and that any information you provide is encrypted and transmitted securely. AimsThe treatment efficacy of laser-induced thermal therapy is greatly enhanced by the presence gold coated nanoshells within the tissue being treated. The nanoshells are turned to exhibit a surface plasmon resonance at the frequency of the incident laser light, dramatically increasing the therapeutic efficiency of the laser treatment. Accurate modeling of the resulting temperature distributions is essential for treatment planning. Analytic solutions are desirable because they give greater insight into the physical meaning of the different terms that contribute to the problem. MethodsThe heat equation is solved by application of the Greens function method and the solution is compared to experimental temperature data for gel phantoms containing different concentrations of nanoshells. The experimental temperature data was obtained by using magnetic resonance temperature imaging methods while the gel was being heated with an 810 nm laser. ResultsReasonable agreement was obtained between the results of the analytic calculation and the experimental data for the various concentrations of nanoshells and laser outputs tested. This agreement was consistent for both the spatial and temporal domain. On average the disagreement between analytical calculation and experiment was 0.93-0.84 degrees C. ConclusionWe have shown that analytic solutions to the heat equation using the Greens function approach can be used to describe experimental temperature distributions due to the presents of nanoshells for various laser powers and nanoshell concentrations. c 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Start by taking the length and width of each room and multiplying those measurements to calculate the square footage of that room. Add up the square footage of each roomand there you have it! Another way to do this is by taking exterior measurements of the entire house and subtracting the square footage of any part of the home not intended to be cooled or heatedlike a basement or garage. Make sure to account for the height of the room, as well. Rooms with tall ceilings tend to demand more BTUs than one with a standard height. Account for factors that affect insulation. Check to see what grade of insulation the home was built with. If you are unsure, U.S. Standard Insulation is probably your best bet. Other key factors that need to be taken into consideration are sun exposure, windows, and airtightness for the entire home.Common factors to be accounted for include Each person living in a home  100 additional BTUs Each window in a home  1,000 additional BTUs Each exterior door in a home  1,000 additional BTUs Think about how the living space is being used.Does this home or particular room have heat-producing appliances? How many people regularly occupy the space you are calculating? This should also inform the HVAC load that will be sufficient to heat or cool the intended area. To calculate the estimated HVAC load for a house with 2,500 square feet, 12 windows, and 3 exterior doors occupied by 4 people, simply plug it into this formula 2,500 x 25  62,500 base BTU 4 people x 400  1,600 12 windows x 1,000  12,000 3 exterior doors x 1,000  3,000 62,500  1,600  12,000  3,000  79,100 BTU The recommended equipment capacities are estimated in good faith and are solely meant for generic, informative purposes.

Thermodynamics deals with the transfer of energy from one place to another and from one form to another. The key concept is that heat is a form of energy corresponding to a definite amount of mechanical work.","Our editors will review what youve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Thermodynamics is the study of the relations between heat, work, temperature, and energy. The laws of thermodynamics describe how the energy in a system changes and whether the system can perform useful work on its surroundings. Yes, thermodynamics is a branch of physics that studies how energy changes in a system. The key insight of thermodynamics is that heat is a form of energy that corresponds to mechanical work that is, exerting a force on an object over a distance. thermodynamics,scienceof the relationship betweenheat,work,temperature, andenergy. In broad terms, thermodynamics deals with thetransfer of energyfrom one place to another and from one form to another. The keyconceptis that heat is a form of energy corresponding to a definite amount ofmechanical work. Heat was not formally recognized as a form of energy until about 1798, when Count Rumford Sir Benjamin Thompson, a British military engineer, noticed that limitless amounts of heat could be generated in the boring of cannon barrels and that the amount of heat generated is proportional to the work done in turning a blunt boring tool. Rumfords observation of the proportionality between heat generated and work done lies at the foundation of thermodynamics. Another pioneer was the French military engineerSadi Carnot, who introduced the concept of the heat-engine cycle and the principle ofreversibilityin 1824. Carnots work concerned the limitations on the maximum amount of work that can be obtained from asteam engineoperating with a high-temperatureheat transferas its driving force. Later that century, these ideas were developed byRudolf Clausius, a German mathematician and physicist, into the first and second laws of thermodynamics, respectively. The most importantlaws of thermodynamicsare Although thermodynamics developed rapidly during the 19th century in response to the need to optimize the performance of steam engines, the sweeping generality of the laws of thermodynamics makes them applicable to all physical and biological systems. In particular, the laws of thermodynamics give a complete description of all changes in the energy state of any system and its ability to perform useful work on its surroundings. This article coversclassical thermodynamics, which does not involve theconsiderationof individualatomsormolecules. Such concerns are the focus of the branch of thermodynamics known as statistical thermodynamics, orstatistical mechanics, which expresses macroscopic thermodynamic properties in terms of the behaviour of individual particles and their interactions. It has its roots in the latter part of the 19th century, when atomic and molecular theories of matter began to be generally accepted. The application of thermodynamic principles begins by defining a system that is in some sense distinct from its surroundings. For example, the system could be a sample ofgasinside a cylinder with a movablepiston, an entiresteam engine, amarathonrunner, the planetEarth, aneutron star, ablack hole, or even the entireuniverse. In general, systems are free to exchangeheat,work, and other forms ofenergywith their surroundings. A systems condition at any given time is called its thermodynamic state. For a gas in a cylinder with a movablepiston, the state of the system is identified by thetemperature,pressure, and volume of the gas. These properties are characteristicparametersthat have definite values at each state and are independent of the way in which the system arrived at that state. In other words, any change in value of a property depends only on the initial and final states of the system, not on the path followed by the system from one state to another. Such properties are called state functions. In contrast, the work done as the piston moves and the gas expands and the heat the gas absorbs from its surroundings depend on the detailed way in which the expansion occurs. The behaviour of a complex thermodynamic system, such asEarths atmosphere, can be understood by first applying the principles of states and properties to its component partsin this case,water, water vapour, and the various gases making up the atmosphere. By isolating samples of material whose states and properties can be controlled andmanipulated, properties and their interrelations can be studied as the system changes from state to state."

This post focuses on solving scientific problems through simulations, such as computational physics. These simulations are essential for advancing our understanding of complex systems and improving various technologies. To understand the framework, we first need a clear vision of Partial Differential Equations PDEs. Then, we will provide a brief overview of Physics-Informed Neural Networks PINNs and their implementation. Multivariable CalculusMultivariable calculus extends single-variable calculus to functions with more than one variable. It involves studying functions that depend on multiple variables and covers concepts such as partial derivatives. Partial derivatives refer to taking the derivative of a function that depends on more than one variable with respect to one variable while keeping the other variables constant. Partial derivatives play an important role in multivariable calculus and help us understand how functions change. For a function fx, y, z,  the partial derivative with respect to x is denoted as fracpartial fpartial x This represents the rate at which f changes as x changes, while y, z, ldots remain constant. There are several common notations for partial derivatives f_x or fracpartial fpartial x for the partial derivative of  f  with respect to  x  A partial differential equation PDE is an equation that contains derivatives of an unknown function that depends on more than one independent variable. PDEs are used to model a wide variety of phenomena in physics, engineering, economics, and other sciences. These equations play a critical role in describing processes such as heat transfer, wave propagation, fluid dynamics, and quantum mechanics. Fleftx_1, x_2, ldots, x_n, u, fracpartial upartial x_1, fracpartial upartial x_2, ldots, fracpartial upartial x_n, fracpartial2 upartial x_12, fracpartial2 upartial x_1 partial x_2, ldots right  0 where u  ux_1, x_2, ldots, x_n is the unknown function, and F is a given function. Heat EquationThe heat equation is a partial differential equation used to model heat diffusion processes. It describes how heat propagates in a medium over time and is often applied to different geometries, such as a rod, plate, or three-dimensional object. frepresents the residual of the governing partial differential equation PDE. For the 2D heat equation, this residual is given by f  u_t - alpha u_xx  u_yy Ideally, if the neural network perfectly satisfies the PDE, the residualfshould be zero for all points in the domain. Here urepresents the temperature distribution as a function of position x, y and time tthe thermal diffusivity of the material alpha Solving partial differential equations PDEs presents several significant challenges By addressing these issues, we can better understand the requirements for effective PDE solutions and the potential for innovative approaches like Physics-Informed Neural Networks PINNs to overcome these challenges. Physics-Informed Neural Networks PINNs offer several advantages for solving partial differential equations PDEs. Here are some key reasons why they are needed Physics-Informed Neural Networks are a powerful tool, especially for problems with data constraints and physical consistency requirements. PINNs provide innovative and effective solutions to problems that are difficult or impossible to solve using traditional methods. When building PINNs, we adhere to neural network principles inputs, hidden layers, outputs, activation functions, loss functions, etc. One of the most important parts is adding a physical loss to the classical neural network loss system to learn with physical laws. In this post, we will implement theHeat Equationmentioned in the previous sections. We will extend the loss function with theHeat Equationloss to minimize the residual of the problem and use traditional constraints like boundaries in our neural network design. PINNs, like other neural networks, use gradient-based numerical optimization techniques to minimize the loss function, such as backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent SGD. After training the Physics-Informed Neural Network PINN model, we can observe the heat diffusion process over time. This involves visualizing the temperature distribution across the medium, showing how heat propagates through the system.Model Output Heat Diffusion Animation AI models offer a powerful method for solving complex partial differential equations PDEs by integrating physical laws into neural network training. The PINN approach ensures physical consistency, efficient computation, and accurate generalization from limited data. In this post, we discussed the basics of PDEs, the advantages of PINNs, and demonstrated their implementation using the 2D heat equation. The results highlighted PINNs ability to model heat diffusion accurately and efficiently. As computational science advances, AI models are set to become invaluable tools for researchers and engineers, enabling the solution of previously intractable problems across various fields.

https://byjus.com/physics/heat-transfer-conduction-convection-and-radiation/,"What Is Heat Transfer? Conduction, Convection, Radiation and FAQs","Heat transfer is defined as the process in which the molecules are moved from the region of higher temperature to lower temperature. Conduction, convection, and radiation are the types of heat transfer.","Any matter which is made up of atoms and molecules has the ability to transfer heat. The atoms are in different types of motion at any time. The motion of molecules and atoms is responsible for heat or thermal energy and every matter has this thermal energy. The more the motion of molecules, more will be the heat energy. However, talking about heat transfer, it is nothing but the process of transfer of heat from a high-temperature body to a low temperature one. According to thermodynamic systems, heat transfer is defined as The movement of heat across the border of the system due to a difference in temperature between the system and its surroundings. Interestingly, the difference in temperature is said to be a potential that causes the transfer of heat from one point to another. Heat can travel from one place to another in several ways. Thedifferent modes of heat transfer include Meanwhile, if the temperature difference exists between the two systems, heat will find a way to transfer from the higher to the lower system. Conduction is defined as The process of transmission of energy from one particle of the medium to another with the particles being in direct contact with each other. An area of higher kinetic energy transfers thermal energy towards the lower kinetic energy area. High-speed particles clash with particles moving at a slow speed, as a result, slow speed particles increase theirkinetic energy. This is a typical form of heat transfer and takes place through physical contact. Conduction is also known as thermal conduction or heat conduction. The rate of conduction can be calculated by the following equation Where, The coefficient of thermal conductivity shows that a metal body conducts heat better when it comes to conduction. Following are the examples of conduction Convection is defined as The movement of fluid molecules from higher temperature regions to lower temperature regions. As the temperature of the liquid increases, the liquids volume also has to increase by the same factor and this effect is known as displacement.The equation to calculate the rate of convection is as follows Q  hc A  Ts Tf Where, Examples of convection include Radiant heat is present in some or other form in our daily lives. Thermal radiations are referred to as radiant heat.Thermal radiation is generated by the emission ofelectromagnetic waves. These waves carry away the energy from the emitting body. Radiation takes place through a vacuum or transparent medium which can be either solid or liquid. Thermal radiation is the result of the random motion of molecules in matter. The movement of charged electrons and protons is responsible for the emission of electromagnetic radiation.Let us know more about radiation heat transfer. Radiation heat transfer is measured by a device known as thermocouple. A thermocouple is used for measuring the temperature. In this device sometimes, error takes place while measuring the temperature through radiation heat transfer. As temperature rises, the wavelength in the spectra of the radiation emitted decreases and shorter wavelengths radiations are emitted.Thermal radiation can be calculated by Stefan-Boltzmann law P  e  σ  A Tr  Tc4 Where, Following are the examples of radiation To know more about heat transfer in detail, click on the video below.

I would love to hear HNs take on this argument. reply See, the reason for the Bitter Lesson being a lesson is that Neural Nets, that Sutton is mainly writing about, are pretty crap at representing background knowledge. The only way you can store expert knowledge in a neural net is to modify its structure and its weights. The weights you can only modify by some kind of learning procedure like backprop, in practice. Very limited forms of background knowledge, like convolutions can be encoded in a neural nets structure, but imagine trying to represent, I dont know, the last ten lines of code you wrote today as a bunch of neural net connections. Continuous functions is just not the right kind of notation for that sort of thing.If neural nets were any better at encoding background knowledge, they would use it, but they cant so they have to rely on data. And thats why they need so much of it. Background knowledge functions as a strong inductive bias- it directs the search for a hypothesis to hypotheses that we know make sense again, think of convolutions. Without background knowledge, or with only a little background knowledge, you need tons of examples to learn anything useful.So the Bitter Lesson is basically making a virtue out of necessity. In any case, its not a prescriptive thing, only descriptive. If neural nets were any better at encoding background knowledge, they would use it, but they cant so they have to rely on data.

https://www.weather.gov/safety/cold-wind-chill-chart,Understanding Wind Chill,No description,"NWSAll NOAA Safety National Program The wind chill temperature is how cold people and animals feel when outside. Wind chill is based on the rate of heat loss from exposed skin caused by wind and cold. As the wind increases, it draws heat from the body, driving down skin temperature and eventually the internal body temperature. Therefore, the wind makes it FEEL much colder. If the temperature is 0F and the wind is blowing at 15 mph, the wind chill is -19F. At this wind chill temperature, exposed skin can freeze in 30 minutes. The NWS Wind Chill Temperature uses advances in science, technology, and computer modeling to provide an accurate, understandable, and useful formula for calculating the dangers from winter winds and freezing temperatures. The index does the following Wind Chill converted toKnots.

This page describes the calculations used to convert greenhouse gas emission numbers into different types of equivalent units.Go to the Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator page for more information. A note on global warming potentials GWPs Some of the equivalencies in the calculator are reported as CO2equivalents CO2e. These are calculated using GWPs from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes Fifth Assessment Report AR5, except for the equivalencies that are calculated using the Waste Reduction Model WARM because the model uses the Fourth Assessment Report tons of waste recycled instead of landfilled, GHG emissions avoided by recycling X garbage trucks or railcars full of waste, and trash bags of waste recycled instead of landfilled. To facilitate user reproducibility calculations that use data from WARM, the input data were not modified to reflect GWPs from AR5. As of 2024, the Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator uses the Emissions  Generation Resource Integrated Database eGRID, which derives regional emission factors for electric power marginal and baseload emissions and enables users to map their residential or commercial zip code to their region. This results in more accurate emissions estimates regarding their energy use relative to the previous national default and affects the electricity used and avoided factors. The regionally specific and national weighted emission rates are presented in Table 1 . Table 1  Emissions  Generation Resource Integrated Database eGRID Subregion Output Emission Rates eGRID2022 Notes Sources The Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator uses the Emissions  Generation Resource Integrated Database eGRID regionally specificornational weighted average CO2marginal emission rate to convert avoided kilowatt-hours into avoided units of carbon dioxide emissions, depending on the user input. Most users of the Equivalencies Calculator who seek equivalencies for electricity-related emissions want to know equivalencies for emissions avoided from energy efficiency EE or renewable energy RE programs. Calculating the emission impacts of EE and RE on the electricity grid requires estimating the amount of fossil-fired generation and emissions being displaced by EE and RE. A marginal emission factor is the best representation to estimate which fossil-fired units EERE are displacing across the fossil fleet. EE and RE programs are not generally assumed to affect baseload power plants that run all the time, but rather marginal power plants that are brought online as necessary to meet demand. Therefore, eGRID provides either a regionally specificornational marginal emission factor for the Equivalencies Calculator, depending on the user input. 1,405.3 lbs CO2MWh  1 metric ton2,204.6 lbs  11-0.051 MWh deliveredMWh generated  1 MWh1,000 kWh  6.72  10-4metric tons CO2kWheGRID, U.S. national weighted average CO2marginal emission rate, year 2022 data Notes The Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator uses the eGRID U.S. regionally specificornational annual average CO2output rate to convert kilowatt-hours of energy use into units of carbon dioxide emissions, depending on the user input.

On average, each home consumed 12,194 kWh of delivered electricity EIA 2023a. The national average carbon dioxide output rate for electricity generated in 2022 was 823.1 lbs CO2per megawatt-hour EPA 2024a, which translates to about 867.5 lbs CO2per megawatt-hour for delivered electricity, assuming transmission and distribution losses of 5.12 EIA 2023b EPA 2024b. The annual 2022 U.S. transmission and distribution TD losses were determined as estimated losses divided by the total disposition less direct use. This TD loss percentage considers utility-reported data including estimated TD losses that occur for the electricity transmitted and distributed in the United States based on total disposition i.e., total electricity supply net of direct use i.e., electricity used by the same industrial or commercial sector facility where it is produced, thus never entering the grid.

A medium growth coniferous or deciduous tree, planted in an urban setting and allowed to grow for 10 years, sequesters 23.2 and 38.0 lbs of carbon, per year respectively. These estimates are based on the following assumptions The estimates of carbon sequestered by coniferous and deciduous trees were then weighted by the percent share of coniferous versus deciduous trees in cities across the United States. Of a sample of approximately 14,000 coniferous and deciduous trees in seventeen major U.S. cities, approximately 11 percent and 89 percent of sampled trees were coniferous and deciduous, respectively McPherson et al. 2016. Therefore, the weighted average annual carbon sequestered by a medium growth coniferous or deciduous tree, planted in an urban setting and allowed to grow for 10 years, is 36.4 lbs of carbon per tree. Trees sequester significantly less carbon in early life than mid life, and carbon sequestration slows in late life. The typical age of each tree species is variable as is the rate of growth, hence this method determines an annual average assuming ten years of growth. Please note the following caveats to these assumptions To convert to units of metric tons CO2per tree, multiply by the ratio of the molecular weight of carbon dioxide to that of carbon 4412 and the ratio of metric tons per pound 12,204.6.

Please refer to the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks 19902022 for a discussion of the definition of U.S. forests and methodology for estimating carbon stored in U.S. forests EPA 2024. Growing forests accumulate and store carbon. Through the process of photosynthesis, trees remove CO2from the atmosphere and store it as cellulose, lignin, and other compounds. The rate of accumulation of carbon in a forested landscape is equal to overall tree growth minus removals i.e., harvest for the production of paper and wood and tree loss from natural disturbances minus decomposition. In most U.S. forests, growth exceeds removals and decomposition, so the amount of carbon stored nationally in forested lands is increasing overall, though at a decreasing rate. TheInventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks 19902022EPA 2024 provides data on the net change in forest carbon stocks and forest area. Annual Net Change in Carbon Stocks per Area in Year t  Carbon Stockst1 - Carbon StockstArea of land remaining in the same land-use category Step 1 Determine the carbon stock change between yearsby subtracting carbon stocks in year t from carbon stocks in year t1. This calculation, also found in theInventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks 19902022EPA 2024, uses the USDA Forest Service estimates of carbon stocks in 2022 minus carbon stocks in 2021. This calculation includes carbon stocks in the aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, dead wood, litter, and soil organic and mineral carbon pools. C gains attributed to harvested wood products are not included in this calculation.

Applying the Step 2 calculation to data developed by the USDA Forest Service for theInventory ofU.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks 19902022yields a result of 221 metric tons of carbon per hectare or 89 metric tons of carbon per acre for the carbon stock density of U.S. forests in 2022, with an annual net change in carbon stock per area in 2022 of 0.67 metric tons of carbon sequestered per hectare per year or 0.27 metric tons of carbon sequestered per acre per year.

From 2014 to 2022, the average annual sequestration of carbon per area was 0.58 metric tons Chectareyear or 0 .23 metric tons Cacreyear in the United States, with a minimum value of 0.52 metric tons Chectareyear or 0.21 metric tons Cacreyear in 2019, and a maximum value of 0.67 metric tons Chectareyear or 0.27 metric tons Cacreyear in 2022. These values include carbon in the five forest pools aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, dead wood, litter, and soil organic and mineral carbon, and are based on state-level Forest Inventory and Analysis FIA data. Forest carbon stocks and carbon stock change are based on the stock difference methodology and algorithms described by Smith, Heath, and Nichols 2010.

Significant geographical variations underlie the national estimates, and the values calculated here might not be representative of individual regions, states, or changes in the species composition of additional acres of forest.

Forests are defined herein as managed forests that have been classified as forests for over 20 years i.e., excluding forests converted tofrom other land-use types. Please refer to theInventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks 19902022for a discussion of the definition of U.S. forests and methodology for estimating carbon stored in U.S. forests EPA 2024. Based on data developed by the USDA Forest Service for theInventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks 19902022, the carbon stock density of U.S. forests in 2022 was 221 metric tons of carbon per hectare or 89 metric tons of carbon per acre EPA 2024b. This estimate is composed of the five carbon pools aboveground biomass 63 metric tons Chectare, belowground biomass 11 metric tons Chectare, dead wood 11 metric tons Chectare, litter 13 metric tons Chectare, and soil carbon, which includes mineral soils 101 metric tons Chectare and organic soils 21 metric tons Chectare. TheInventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks 19902022estimates soil carbon stock changes using U.S.-specific equations, IPCC guidance, and data from the USDA Natural Resource Inventory and the DayCent biogeochemical model EPA 2024b. When calculating carbon stock changes in biomass due to conversion from forestland to development, the 2019 IPCC Refinement indicates that the average carbon stock change is equal to the carbon in biomass on the land use immediately after the conversion e.g., development minus the carbon lost that was in biomass on the land use prior to the conversion e.g., forest land plus the carbon stocks from one year of biomass growth and soil organic carbon stock change in the new or current land use IPCC 2019. All of the biomass carbon from the prior land use is assumed to be lost in the year the land use change occurs for conversion to development therefore the carbon stock in annual development biomass after one year is conservatively estimated to be 0 metric tons C per hectare IPCC 2019. The averaged reference soil carbon stock for high-activity clay, low-activity clay, sandy soils, and histosols for all climate regions in the United States is 40.83 metric tons Chectare EPA 2024a. Carbon stock change in soils is time-dependent, with a default time period for transition between equilibrium soil carbon values of 20 years IPCC 2006. Consequently, it is assumed that the change in equilibrium soil carbon will be annualized over 20 years to represent the annual flux in mineral and organic soils. Organic soils also emit CO2when drained. Emissions from drained organic soils in forestland and drained organic soils in development vary based on the drainage depth and climate IPCC 2006. TheInventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks 19902022estimates emissions from drained organic soils using U.S.-specific emission factors for development and IPCC 2014 default emission factors for forestland EPA 2024a. The annual change in emissions from one hectare of drained organic soils can be calculated as the difference between the emission factors for forest soils and development soils. The emission factors for drained organic soil on temperate forestland are 2.60 metric tons Chectareyear and 0.31 metric tons Chectareyear EPA 2024a, IPCC 2014, and the average emission factor for drained organic soil on development for all climate regions cool temperate, warm temperate, and subtropical is 13.17 metric tons Chectareyear EPA 2024a. States identified as having drained organic soils include Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin EPA 2024b. The IPCC 2006 Guidelines assume that all deadwood and litter carbon are lost in conversion to development and do not subsequently accumulate, hence the carbon stocks for these pools after conversion is assumed to be 0 IPCC 2006.

In view of the great potential of hydrogen in energy transformation and sustainable development around the world, how to realize the adequate transportation of hydrogen has become a hot spot of concern1. Among them, as a critical form of hydrogen transportation, natural gas hydrogen mixing technology is developing rapidly. Meanwhile, as a new type of pipeline  hydropower, gas, etc.  laying method is necessary for developing civilized cities, the construction of underground pipe galleries is also in full swing. The twos rapid growth and application overlap will inevitably lead to many hydrogen-doped natural gas pipelines passing through the underground pipe gallery to deliver hydrogen to end users. According to statistics, large-scale natural gas pipelines are currently laid in the underground pipe gallery. It is worth noting that the change in the conveying medium will inevitably lead to a difference in the fluid dynamics performance of the leakage and diffusion behavior of the medium and further affect the response of the relevant safety control measures2,3,4,5. Therefore, exploring the leakage and diffusion characteristics of hydrogen-doped natural gas pipelines in the underground pipe gallery can enhance the understanding of safety management and control and help to further promote the development of energy transformation and low-carbon society. Methane and hydrogen leakage, diffusion, and explosion in confined or semi-confined environments have been the subject of numerous investigations by domestic and international researchers. When the hydrogen blending ratio was less than 50, the accumulation behavior of hydrogen-doped natural gas was comparable to that of pure natural gas, according to Lowesmiths6study on the leakage and accumulation behavior of hydrogen-doped natural gas in confined areas. Wilkening et al.7simulated the diffusion and leakage of pure methane and H2-CH4mixture gas in the pipeline under windy and windless conditions, respectively, and discovered that the mixed gass leakage rate and volume were greater than methanes. The research of Li Du8and Li Ranran et al.9. showed that the static storage of hydrogen-doped natural gas after leakage in the kitchen would cause gas stratification, and different gas components and leakage conditions had significant effects on the concentration distribution. In order to examine the diffusion law and leakage of hydrogen-doped natural gas in a valve chamber under various hydrogen volume concentrations, wind speeds, leakage diameters, and leakage port directions, Jia Wenlong et al.10used a typical valve chamber from the West-East Gas Pipeline as an example. Stefano11and Mohammad et al.12. studied how the diffusion of hydrogen in a confined space is significantly affected by the leak rate, while the leak location is less affected, and revealed the diffusion behavior of the gas and measured the danger height and vanishing moment. Gupta et al.13s research shows that the peak concentration of helium leakage in a closed garage is mainly determined by the total amount of leakage, while the leakage rate affects the gas mixing behavior. In addition, Jiang, H et al.14based on the case of 6.13 explosion accident in Shiyan City, Hubei Province, calculated the amount of natural gas involved from three perspectives TNT equivalent of explosion energy, damage to buildings and overpressure distribution in buildings. Some scholars have conducted relevant studies on the gas leakage and diffusion of public pipe corridors. From the perspective of gas leakage and diffusion characteristics, Lei Peng et al.15studied the diffusion of hydrogen leakage in the pipe gallery and found that the contact time after gas injection was long, resulting in slow propagation speed. Zhou Ning et al.16simulated the diffusion process of natural gas in an underground pipeline corridor and found that under the action of wind, natural gas diffused in a snail shape and the turbulence intensity increased. From the perspective of leakage influencing factors, Duan Pengfei et al.1718studied the influence of leakage hole direction, diameter and hydrogen mixing ratio on natural gas concentration distribution. Sun et al.19found that higher pipeline pressure increases the amount of gas leaking and accelerates the injection rate, leading to concentration stratification. Li Jingtao et al.20found that increased slope would shorten the alarm response time. Zhang Chenglong et al.21analyzed the influence of multi-factor coupling on leakage and simulated leakage scenario. From the perspective of alarm and safety, Some scholars analyzed the process of leakage alarm and accident ventilation in the pipe gallery from the Angle of alarm and safety, and put forward the alarm scheme18,22. However, the leakage and diffusion of hydrogen-doped natural gas at home and abroad rarely consider the leakage of long and narrow underground structures such as pipe corridors. In addition, the current study mainly analyzes the gas leakage and diffusion behavior under fixed ventilation frequency and inlet and outlet spacing, and neural network prediction is less applied in this area, and more work needs to be done to fill these gaps. Therefore, a numerical model of leakage and diffusion of hydrogen-doped natural gas in the integrated pipeline corridor is established in this paper, and the difference of concentration distribution and velocity field of hydrogen-doped natural gas is analyzed under the conditions of different inlet speed, inlet and outlet spacing, hydrogen ratio and leakage port size. The explosion risk volume of methane and hydrogen under different conditions is predicted by backpropagation neural network. GA-BPANN can accurately model complex nonlinear relationships and process high-dimensional data. This method can be used for rapid and flexible risk assessment under various conditions, and can provide reliable information for safety design. It can influence the ventilation design of pipeline corridors, the layout design of hydrogen-doped natural gas pipelines, and the formulation of emergency repair strategies for pipeline corridors. The technical route is shown in Fig.1. Technology roadmap. The leakage and diffusion of gas in the pipe gallery first satisfies the law of conservation of mass23. the continuous equation of gas leakage and diffusion in the pipe gallery is shown in Eq. 1. Where,ρis the gas density  kgm3.uis the velocity field of fluid ms. The leakage and diffusion of hydrogen-doped natural gas in the pipe gallery must satisfy the law of conservation of energy24, and its energy equation is shown in Eq. 2.

After the leakage and diffusion of hydrogen-doped natural gas pipeline in the pipe gallery, it will continuously blend with the air in the pipe gallery, which belongs to the blending and transmission of different components26. There is no chemical reaction in this process, so the component transmission equation is equation 6. Where,omegais the mass fraction of the component,D_tis the turbulent diffusion coefficient  m2s . The Realizable k-ε turbulence model is used to represent the turbulent motion based on the features of the hydrogen-doped natural gas jet. Compared with the standardk-εmodel, the realizablek-εmodel shows substantial improvement, mainly in the case of flow field including strong streamline curvature, eddy current and rotation. The model is capable of accurately simulating gas leakage and diffusion processes, turbulent flow, jet flow, and mixed flow27,28,29,30. This models equation can be found in 7 and 831.

As seen in Fig.2a, a three-dimensional physical model of the gas chamber of a 200 m  1.8 m  2.4 m common pipe gallery was built. The installation spacing of pipes in the independent cabin of the public works pipe gallery is described in Fig.2b in accordance with the Chinese national standard GB 50,838  2015 Technical Code for Urban Comprehensive Pipe Corridor Engineering,32and the pipe gallery is 1.8 m wide and 2.4 m high. The seamless steel pipe used for the hydrogen-doped natural gas pipeline has DN250, 400 mm a, 500 mm, and 800 mm for b1and b2, respectively. Considering the current state of engineering design, The air inlet and outlet have the same dimensions 1 m by 1 m. The pipe gallery is reduced to a long, narrow, rectangular building that has ventilatable walls on the left and right sides. The hydrogen-doped natural gas pipeline has a leak hole in the middle of its upper surface. The model mainly simulates the diffusion of hydrogen-doped natural gas in the pipe gallery after leakage into the atmosphere from small holes and analyzes the effects of ventilation velocity, inlet and outlet spacing, hydrogen blending ratio, and leakage port size on the diffusion of hydrogen-doped natural gas. Combined with several features of the model, a hexahedral mesh-based meshing strategy was adopted. The grid encryption grid is set up at the air inlet, outlet, and leak hole for locations prone to large velocity gradients, as shown in Fig.2c. Numerical model a 3D pipe gallery model, b installation spacing of pipes in pipe gallery, c mesh generation strategy. This paper, based on the Technical Specifications for Urban Comprehensive Pipe Tunnel Engineering, explores the effects of pipe body factors and ventilation conditions on the diffusion behavior of hydrogen-contaminated natural gas leaks33. The selected influencing factors are listed in Table1. According to the influencing factors, specific scenarios were designed as shown in Table2. The thermodynamic properties of the mixture gas can be calculated based on the gas mixture rules. Where,xiis the percentage of theigas mis the average molar mass, kgmol cp, mis the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, JkgK cv, mis the constant volume specific heat capacity, JkgK. The temperature of the manhole space, leaking point, intake, and exhaust is set to 300 K, and the pressure is set to standard atmospheric pressure during the first stage of hydrogen-containing natural gas leakage. One way to think about the gas leaking process is as a small hole leakage problem34. According to the critical pressure ratio classification, the natural gas flow velocity can be divided into supersonic and subsonic. The critical pressure ratio is Where,kis the isentropic index of gas. WhenPaP2β, the gas flow rate of the leakage hole is subsonic, and the leakage rate is Where,Pais atmospheric pressure, Pa P2is the pipeline pressure, Pa C0is the correction coefficient of orifice leakage, and the circular orifice is taken as 1 Ais the area of leakage orifice, m2Mis the molar mass of the leaking gas, kgmol. WhenPaP2β, the gas flow rate of the leakage hole is sonic, and the leakage rate is The normal ventilation frequency must be at least six times per hour, and the accident ventilation frequency must be at least twelve times per hour, as per the Chinese national standard GB 50,838  2015, Technical Specifications for Urban Integrated pipe Corridor Engineering. The average wind velocity method35was used to determine the ventilation velocity of air intake under mechanical ventilation settings. where,vis the average wind speed of the inlet, ms nis the ventilation frequency, timesh Vis the volume of the pipe gallery, m3A0is the area of the inlet, m2. Equation 17 can be used to determine the wind speed corresponding to various ventilation frequencies in a two-dimensional simplified numerical model with model width as unit length. Table3displays the results of the computation. The explosion limit of hydrogen-doped natural gas is calculated using Le Chateliers mixing rule. The explosion limit of methane is 5.0015.00, and the explosion limit of hydrogen is 4.0075.60. Le Chateliers law is as Eq. 17, 18. Where,LELmixandUELmixare the upper and lower limits of the explosion of the mixed gas,yiis the volume fraction of a kind of gas in the mixed gas sis the total number of gas species contained in the mixed gas LELiandUELi are the upper and lower explosion limits of a certain kind of gas in a mixed gas. The parameters of mixed gas under different hydrogen mixing ratios can be obtained by calculation, as shown in Table4. The FLUENT finite volume method was used to solve the equations related to the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy36. A hydrogen-doped natural gas leakage port, an air inlet, an air outlet, two side outlets, a pipe wall, and a pipe corridor wall comprise the models primary boundaries. The combination of CH4and H2is separated into various proportions within the group, and the temperature is set at 300 K. The mass flow rate inlet is chosen as the boundary condition of the hydrogen-doped natural gas leakage port10,36. The group is separated into air, and the air inlet is configured as the speed inlet. The Outlet boundary condition often refers to the gas outlet end, which is set as a Pressure Outlet to simulate the gas diffusion perpendicular to the wall under the action of the airflow. In the setting of the wall boundary, since thermal analysis is not the focus of this paper, the research wall is set as an isothermal wall with a temperature of 300K17,36. The boundary condition Settings are shown in Table5. It is assumed that the flow field in the calculation area is in a stable state before the leakage of the natural gas pipeline, and the velocity and concentration of methane and hydrogen are 036. The area with a high gradient of data change, particularly the area surrounding the leak hole, needs to be locally adjusted in order to lower computing complexity and increase numerical accuracy. Wind speed of 2.4 ms, intake and outlet spacing of 200 m, HBR of 20, and leakage size of 20 mm were the parameters used to study grid independence. Four grid schemes with grid numbers of 1,202,370, 1,523,970, 2,172,970 and 3,430,000 were used for calculation. The variation of methane concentration in the vertical Y direction of the leak hole location under the four grid schemes is shown in Fig.3a. Mesh quality verification is usually evaluated through a series of quantitative metrics, such as maximum skew, aspect ratio, etc37. Therefore, the maximum skew of the four meshes is compared, and the results are shown in Fig.3b. As can be seen from the figure, when the number of grids reaches 3,430,000, the calculation results gradually tend to be stable. In order to meet the requirements of simulation accuracy and efficiency, the number of meshes used in subsequent simulations was 3,430,000.

A leakage and diffusion experiment of hydrogen-doped natural gas in a home kitchen was chosen for comparative analysis in order to confirm the accuracy of the numerical model8. The kitchen model data was obtained from the literature and had dimensions of 2.5 m by 1.6 m by 2.6 m, as illustrated in Fig.4a. The leak hole is 8 mm in size, with a leakage flow rate of 4 and 8 Nm3h, 80 nitrogen, and 20 helium. The monitoring points 1 0.76, 0.50, 1.15, 5 1.50, 0.50, 1.68, 8 1.50, 0.50, 0.20, and 9 0.50, 1.55, 2.05 are displayed in Fig.4b and c. Simulations and experimental findings on oxygen concentration. At these two instances, it is evident that the trend of the computer findings and the experimental results is consistent. These two leakage flows had maximum and average absolute deviations of 1.20 and 1.20, respectively, 34 and 1.60 and 2.19. The numerical models dependability is confirmed by the deviation value, which is within an acceptable range and quite tiny.

Given that the city comprehensive pipe gallerys gas tank has a medium- and low-pressure hydrogen-doped natural gas pipeline leak, this part includes varying wind speeds 1.4, 1.9, 2.4, and 2.9 ms, input and outlet spacing 50, 100, 150, and 100 m, hydrogen mixing ratio 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and leakage port size 10 mm, 20 mm, 30 mm, 40 mm Influence on leakage and diffusion characteristics of hydrogen-doped natural gas in gas tanks in urban integrated pipeline corridors. Figure5shows the distribution of the leakage gas concentration field and velocity field in the pipe gallery under different leakage port sizes when the air inlet and outlet spacing is 200 m, HBR is 20, and the wind speed is 2.4 ms. Distribution of hydrogen-doped natural gas under different leakage pore sizes a, concentration field b, velocity field. As shown in Fig.5a, as the size of the leakage increases, the high-volume fraction of gas above the pipe gallery becomes more concentrated, while hydrogen-doped natural gas accumulates more around the leakage port beneath the pipeline. The concentration beneath the air inlet is mainly concentrated at the top of the pipe gallery, though it remains lower than that at the air outlet. Notably, when the leakage port is 10 mm, a stratification phenomenon of hydrogen-doped natural gas appears in the pipe gallery. This layering effect gradually diminishes as the leakage port size increases. When the leakage is 40 mm, the overall concentration level in the pipe gallery is significantly high, resulting in an extremely hazardous situation. As seen in Fig.5b, the increase in leakage size alters the streamline structure within the pipeline gallery, with a substantial expansion of the high-velocity diffusion area. When the leakage port size increases to 20 mm, the length of the vortex area beneath the air inlet increases, causing the streamlines downstream of the pipe gallery to no longer converge, and the concentration distribution becomes broader. As the leakage port size reaches 40 mm, the vortex structure beneath the air inlet disappears. The gas accumulation above the pipe gallery increases, and the leakage velocity above the leakage port rises sharply. Simultaneously, part of the leaking gas is carried into the middle and lower spaces of the pipe gallery, leading to an increase in gas concentration in the lower areas. Changes in the explosion volume of hydrogen-doped natural gas under different leakage orifice sizes. Figure6illustrates the variation of the explosion volume of hydrogen-doped natural gas at different leak orifice sizes. Compared with the standard operating condition, when the leakage aperture size increased from 20 mm to 40 mm, the explosion volume of CH4decreased by 52.99 and 99.88 respectively. The explosion volume of H2increased by 143.48 and 214.58. When the leakage aperture size is reduced from 20 mm to 10 mm, the explosion volume of CH4is reduced by 29.23 respectively. The H2explosion volume is reduced by 100. Among them, the larger the leakage hole, the smaller the methane explosion volume in the pipe gallery. This phenomenon is mainly because when the natural gas leakage is large, the concentration of methane in the confined space will increase rapidly, and the methane concentration will soon exceed the upper limit of the explosion UEL. After exceeding the UEL, the concentration of methane in the gas mixture is too high, and the oxygen is insufficient to support combustion or explosion. As a result, this part of the area where the concentration exceeds the UEL is no longer explosive but out of the blast range. The explosion volume of hydrogen can be increased all the time because the upper and lower explosion limits of hydrogen are wide and less limited by the upper and lower explosion limits. As the leakage increases, the concentration of hydrogen rises rapidly in the confined space, and the upper limit of the explosion is less exceeded, resulting in an increase in the effective explosion volume. Figure7shows the distribution of the leakage gas concentration field and velocity field in the pipe gallery under different hydrogen doping ratios when the spacing between the air inlet and outlet is 200 m, the leakage aperture size is 20 mm, and the wind speed is 2.4 ms. Distribution of hydrogen-blended natural gas with different hydrogen doping volume ratios a, concentration field b, velocity field. Figure7a shows the distribution of the leakage gas concentration field in the pipe gallery. Compared with natural gas, when the hydrogen blending ratio is 5 and 10, the concentration field does not change obviously, and the concentration distribution law is similar. When the hydrogen doping ratio is increased to 15, the high volume fraction of gas near the air inlet of the leakage port gathers above the pipe gallery, and the gas concentration distribution near the air outlet has little effect. When the HBR value is 20, the downwind danger area near the outlet increases significantly, but the gas concentration above the pipe gallery in the direction of the air inlet is low, and most of the hydrogen-doped natural gas gathers below the air outlet and at the top of the pipe gallery. It is shown that hydrogen mixing will increase the safety risk of public pipe corridors after pipeline leakage. Figure7b shows the velocity field distribution of leakage gas in the pipe gallery. Observing the velocity streamlines diagram of different hydrogen doping ratios, it can be found that hydrogen doping does not significantly change the streamline structure of the pipeline corridor but only lifts the vortex line near the air inlet and increases the length of the vortex area so that a fast flow area is formed under the pipeline on the left side of the leakage port so that the gas is not easy to accumulate at the bottom of the pipe corridor. Variation of the explosion volume of hydrogen-doped natural gas under different hydrogen-doped volume ratios. As can be seen from Fig.8, Compared with the standard condition, the explosion volume of CH4is reduced by 9.78, 10.78, 13.55 and 12.25 respectively when the hydrogen mixture ratio is reduced from 20 to 0. The explosion volume of H2is reduced by 86.55, 100, 100, 100. In particular, when the hydrogen mixture ratio is 010, the explosion volume of H2is close to 0. the larger the hydrogen doping ratio, the larger the explosion volume of methane and hydrogen in the pipe gallery, which is mainly related to the explosion limit characteristics and their behavior in the gas mixture. One is that the explosion limit LEL and UEL of hydrogen is wider than that of methane. With the increase in the number of hydrogen gas integrals in the leaked gas, the range of hydrogen concentrations that can form explosive mixtures in the pipe gallery increases. The second is that hydrogen diffuses faster than methane. After being mixed with hydrogen, the mixed gas diffuses faster in the pipe gallery and is easy to form a homogeneous mixture in a larger area. This rapid diffusion property may allow larger volumes of gas mixtures to reach the explosive concentration range, resulting in an increase in the explosive volumes of methane and hydrogen. Therefore, in relatively enclosed spaces such as pipe corridors, the explosion volume of methane and hydrogen increases significantly. This phenomenon requires special attention in industrial safety management to prevent a greater risk of explosion due to increased hydrogen doping. Figure9shows the distribution of the leakage gas concentration field and velocity field in the pipe gallery at wind speed when the spacing between the air inlet and outlet is 200 m, the HBR is 20, and the leakage aperture size is 20 mm. Distribution of hydrogen-doped natural gas at different wind speeds a concentration field b velocity field. Figure9ashows the distribution of the leakage gas concentration field in the pipe gallery. It can be seen that with the increase in wind speed, the gas concentration at the air inlet decreases significantly, and the hydrogen-doped natural gas with a high volume fraction no longer gathers above the pipe gallery at the air inlet. According to the concentration distribution of hydrogen-doped natural gas at the air outlet, it can be seen that with the increase in wind speed, the high volume fraction of gas accumulation above the pipe gallery at the air outlet and the accumulation degree of hydrogen-doped natural gas below the pipeline is also reduced. On the whole, the increase in wind speed reduces the concentration of hydrogen-doped natural gas in the pipe gallery as a whole, and the danger range is reduced. Figure9bshows the velocity field distribution of leaked gas in the pipe gallery. With the increase of wind speed, the vortex area below the air inlet gradually increases, and more hydrogen-doped natural gas with a high volume fraction enters the downstream of the pipe gallery through the vortex, which accelerates the gas flow in the overall pipe gallery space. The velocity streamlines below the air outlet gradually move downward, pushing the high volume fraction of gas under the pipe to flow to the air outlet, which reduces the accumulation of hydrogen-doped natural gas at the bottom of the pipe gallery to a certain extent. Variation of the explosion volume of hydrogen-doped natural gas at different inlet wind speeds. As can be seen from Fig.10, Compared with the standard condition, when the inlet wind speed increases from 2.4 ms to 2.9 ms, the explosion volume of CH4decreases by 35.68 and that of H2decreases by 20.50. When the inlet wind speed decreased from 2.4 ms to 1.4 ms, the explosion volume of CH4first decreased by 3.79 and then increased by 20.43. The explosion volume of H2first decreases by 0.28 and then increases by 8.91. So the methane explosion volume dropped even more. In confined spaces, the larger the ventilation velocity, the smaller the explosion volume of methane and hydrogen leakage, which is mainly related to the dilution effect of ventilation on methane and hydrogen concentrations and the control of mixed gas concentrations. Ventilation can dilute the concentration of leaking gases. As the number of ventilations increases, fresh air entering the space can dilute leaked methane and hydrogen, making them less concentrated in the air. When ventilation is strong enough, the concentration of methane and hydrogen falls below the lower explosion limit LEL, reducing or completely eliminating the volume of explosive gases. It can be seen that with proper ventilation design, the leaking hydrogen-doped natural gas can be quickly controlled below the safe concentration, thus effectively preventing the risk of explosion. The effect of ventilation on the volume reduction of methane and hydrogen explosions in confined spaces varies, mainly related to the explosion limit, molecular mass, and diffusivity of methane and hydrogen. Methane and hydrogen have different explosion limits. Methane has a narrow explosion limit of 515 volume fraction, while hydrogen has a wide explosion limit of 475. This means that even at low concentrations, hydrogen can still cause an explosion, while methane only explodes in a relatively small concentration range. Secondly, hydrogen has a smaller molecular mass 2 gmol and, therefore, diffuses faster in the air Hydrogen diffuses more easily and occupies a larger space. In summary, although ventilation can reduce the explosion volume of methane and hydrogen, due to the wide explosion limit, fast diffusion, and fast flame propagation speed of hydrogen, ventilation often requires stricter control and more effective ventilation design to reduce the risk of hydrogen explosion. Figure11shows the distribution of the leakage gas concentration field and velocity field in the pipe gallery under different inlet and outlet spacing when the leakage aperture size is 20 mm, the HBR is 20, and the wind speed is 2.4 ms. Distribution of hydrogen-doped natural gas at different inlet and outlet spacing a concentration field b velocity field. Figure11a shows the distribution of the leakage gas concentration field in the pipe gallery. On the whole, when the spacing between the air inlets and outlets is 50 m, the overall concentration level of the pipe gallery is the lowest, and the area of high-volume hydrogen-doped natural gas distribution is the smallest. When the spacing is 50 m, the second air inlet is located above the leakage, resulting in a low distribution of hydrogen-doped natural gas upstream of the pipe gallery, and at the same time, it works together with the air inlet at 200 m to aggregate the gas at the air outlet of 150 m, resulting in the smallest aggregation of hydrogen-doped natural gas with high volume fraction. When the spacing is 100 m, the air outlet is located above the leakage port, and the leaked gas can directly escape out of the pipe gallery due to the joint action of its own jet and the air inlet on both sides, but because there is only one air outlet, the overall concentration level is higher than that of 50 m. As the spacing between the air inlets and outlets increases, the overall concentration level increases, and the hazard range increases. It shows that the distance between the air outlet and the leakage point greatly affects the concentration level of hydrogen-doped natural gas in the pipe gallery. Figure11b shows the velocity field distribution of leakage gas in the pipe gallery. Observing the cloud image, it can be seen that the increase of the spacing between the inlet and outlet has little effect on the velocity on the center line of the jet but completely changes the streamline of the diffusion of hydrogen-doped natural gas. When the spacing between the air inlets and outlets is 50 m, the air intakes on both sides and in the center of the pipe gallery promote the diffusion of hydrogen-doped natural gas to the air outlets on the left and right sides of the leakage port, and the overall fluidity is strong. When the spacing between the air inlet and outlet is 100 m, the air outlet is located above the leakage port, and the air inlets on both sides promote the diffusion of hydrogen-doped natural gas out of the pipe gallery. The concentration distribution of the air inlet and outlet spacing of 150 m and the spacing of 200 m is similar, but the shorter the spacing, the shorter the distance of hydrogen-doped natural gas diffusion, which is conducive to the reduction of the concentration level of hydrogen-doped natural gas in the pipe gallery. Variation of the explosion volume of hydrogen-doped natural gas at different inlet and outlet spacing. As shown in Fig.12, Compared with the standard working condition, when the inlet and outlet spacing is reduced from 200 m to 50 m, the explosion volume of CH4is reduced by 49.81, 3.21 and 99.92, and the explosion volume of H2is reduced by 8.12 and 100. This phenomenon is closely related to factors such as ventilation efficiency, gas diffusion behavior, and concentration distribution. When the spacing between the air inlets and outlets of the pipe gallery is large, the ventilation efficiency will be reduced. As the airflow passes through the corridor over long distances, it gradually weakens, resulting in a decrease in the velocity of the airflow. The reduced ventilation efficiency means that the leaking gas cannot be quickly discharged or diluted in the pipe gallery and tends to accumulate in some areas, and methane and hydrogen can easily accumulate and reach concentrations between the lower explosion limit LEL and the upper limit UEL, thus increasing the explosion volume in that area. The long-distance air inlet and outlet will lead to the formation of a clear gas concentration gradient in the pipe gallery that is, the concentration is higher in the area near the leakage source, and the concentration may be lower in the area away from the air outlet. Among them, when the spacing between air inlets and outlets increases from 100 m to 200 m, the explosion volume of methane decreases first and then increases. This is because the explosive volume of hydrogen gas increases rapidly due to the accumulation of airflow, which occupies a large amount of pipe gallery space. Then, with the increase of the spacing between the air inlets and outlets, the accumulation effect of the airflow is further strengthened, the volume fraction of hydrogen is smaller, and the diffusion degree is limited, so the explosion volume of methane increases. Latin Hypercube Sampling LHS is a hierarchical stochastic process that provides an efficient way to sample variables from a given distribution38. For the four factors studied, LHS was sampled within their respective ranges. The value ranges are leakage flow velocity 0.02470.3958 kgs, hydrogen doping ratio 020, wind speed 1.42.9 ms, and air inlet and outlet spacing 50200 m. The sampled experimental data are shown in Table6. In order to eliminate the influence of dimensions on the prediction results, the data need to be normalized39. The maximum-minimum normalization method is usually used to normalize the sample data into the 0,1 interval, as shown in Eq. 19. Where,xiandx_iprime is the data before and after standardization,x_hboxmax andx_hboxmin is the maximum and minimum value of the sample data. The way the human brain functions is the basis for modeling backpropagation neural networks. The most popular neural network model at the moment is the BPNN algorithm. An input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer are all part of BPNN40. The acquired simulation data is used to train and learn hidden layer neurons, which reflect the input-output relationship. Following adequate education, the studys findings were reviewed. The trained model can be used to forecast new outputs once the learning outcomes are approved. Thus, BPNNs can be used to address complicated nonlinear problems. The explosion danger volume of hydrogen and methane in the pipe gallery was predicted in this investigation using BPNN. In this study, the leakage orifice d, hydrogen doping ratio HBR, wind speed v,and inlet and outlet spacingD were found in the input layer. There are four input points in the input layer, and the output layer includes the explosion volume Vgas of methane and hydrogen. The relationship between input and output can be expressed as Eq. 20. A BPNN with a three-layer prediction model was developed in order to derive the explosion volume V of hydrogen and methane at the maximum horizontal diffusion distance from this unknown function. As seen in Fig. 1441, there are one node in the output layer and four nodes in the input layer. The number of neurons in the hidden layer can be obtained according to the Kolmogorov theorem or through the training test of different hidden layer node numbers. The more nodes, the easier to overfit, the fewer nodes, will increase the error. Usually, the approximate interval of N is determined by the equations 21 and 22, and then the optimal number N is obtained by many experiments42. where,Nis the number of hidden layer nodes,mis the number of output layer nodes,nis the number of input layer nodes, andcis a constant of  0,10 . The training effect is optimum when N is 4, according to a comparison and analysis of the prediction outcomes under the number of nodes in various hidden layers. As a result, Fig.13displays the topology of BPNN, which is 4-4-1. The learning rate is set to 0.01 the minimum training error is 1  10 6 the training times are 1000 times the maximum number of failures is 6 times the output layer neurons transfer function is chosen as a pure line and the hidden layer neurons transfer function is chosen as transit. Neural network topology. The accuracy of the final prediction findings is significantly impacted by the weights and thresholds that are first established in BP-ANN. Local optimality may arise during model execution if these parameters are assigned at random using conventional procedures4344. The genetic algorithm to optimize the back propagation neural network can improve the generalization ability of the model and avoid falling into the overfitting problem. The genetic algorithm optimizes the initial weights and biases through the global search ability, which overcomes the limitation that the traditional BP neural network is easy to fall into the local optimum, thus reducing the over-fitting of the model to the training data. The selection function is the geometric selection of the norm, the mutation function is the uncombined mutation and the hybridization function is the two-point hybridization with an initial population size of 10 and a maximum evolutionary program of 50. The GA chromosome has 25 genes weight 4  4  1  4  20, threshold 4  1  5. The optimization process of the genetic algorithm is illustrated in Fig.14. Genetic algorithm optimization process. There were two sets of experimental data used in the GA-BP-ANN model a training set and a validation set45. The model is constructed and trained in the training group, and its usability is confirmed in the validation group. Fifty sets of simulated data were included in the experimental data. The model is learned and trained using 70 of the dataset, and the set is validated using 30. In the end, 15 validation samples and 35 training samples were acquired. The GA-BP-ANN training was completed at last. The fitness value is a crucial measure of chromosomal quality in the iterative GA process. The quality of each member of the chromosomal set is indicated by the fitness value. The neural network represented by each chromosome is trained to determine the fitness value based on the training data. The result is the total of the absolute values of the errors in the prediction of all nodes in the output layer, as indicated in Eq. 23. where,Nis the number of samples,fiandyithe predicted and true values of the explosion volume,i 1, 2, 3,. n. Neural network prediction results aFfitcurve b fitting of the actual and predicted values of the train set c fitting of the actual and predicted values of the test set. Figure15a presents the curve for GA-BP-AN. During the iteration process, the overall value decreases as the number of iterations increases, indicating that the genetic algorithm optimization is progressing in the right direction. For methane and hydrogen explosion volume predictions, the average fitness values of the populations began to stabilize after approximately 30 and 15 iterations, respectively. In the methane group, the weight and threshold of the evolved individuals reached optimal values after 30 iterations, while in the hydrogen group, only 15 iterations were required. Figure15b and c demonstrate how well the training sets actual and projected values match the test set. The constructed GA-BP-ANN model is shown to have strong approximation capacity when the correlation coefficient R2between the actual output data and the expected data is near 1. Furthermore, the model performance evaluation index may also be determined using the square correlation coefficient R2 and the root mean square error RMSE, and the equations are computed as Eqs. 24 and 25. Where,mathop ylimits - is the average true value. Table7displays the findings of a neural network-based prediction of the methane and hydrogen explosion volume. The established GA-BPANN prediction models viability is confirmed by the training set datas R2of 0.84 and 0.91 and the test set datas R2of 0.83 and 0.85. This research uses numerical simulation to model the diffusion distribution of hydrogen-doped natural gas in the extensive pipe gallery. Analysis was done on the impacts of various parameters on the hydrogen explosion volume, methane, concentration field distribution, and velocity field distribution of hydrogen-doped natural gas. BPNN was used to establish a prediction model of the explosion volume of methane and hydrogen after diffusion stabilization of hydrogen-doped natural gas under multi-factor coupling. The conclusion is as follows 1 The centerline of the hydrogen-doped natural gas jets jet in the near-field region is greatly influenced by the leakage holes diameter. As the leakage holes size increases, the explosion volume of hydrogen rapidly increases while the explosion volume of methane first increases and then decreases. The majority of the hydrogen-doped natural gas is collected at the top of the pipe gallery and beneath the air outlet, and the explosion volume of hydrogen and methane in the pipe gallery increases with the hydrogen blending ratio. The horizontal jet centerline of the hydrogen-doped natural gas is also deflected upward earlier. 2 With the increase of wind speed, the gas concentration at the air inlet decreases significantly, and the hydrogen-doped natural gas with high volume fraction no longer gathers above the pipe gallery at the air inlet, and the explosion volume of methane and hydrogen in the pipe gallery decreases. The distance between the air outlet and the leakage point greatly affects the concentration level of hydrogen-doped natural gas in the pipe gallery, and the long-distance air inlet and outlet will lead to the formation of an obvious gas concentration gradient in the pipe gallery, that is, the concentration is higher in the area near the leakage source, and the concentration may be lower in the area far away from the air outlet. 3 A GA-BPNN surrogate model that can be used to predict the dangerous explosion volume of methane and hydrogen was established. The R2 of the training set data and the R2 of the test set data are 0.83 and 0.85, respectively, which verifies the accuracy of the surrogate model. 4 According to the results of the study, reasonable design of Distance between inlet and outlet and air flow configuration can help to quickly discharge harmful gases and ensure safe evacuation and equipment maintenance in the pipe gallery in an emergency. Therefore, in the design of pipeline infrastructure, for important facilities or high-risk areas, a reasonable mixing ratio of hydrogen should be designed and ensured within the safety threshold of pipeline operation. Moreover, the spacing and wind speed of the inlet and outlet of the pipe corridor should be optimized so that the air can be evenly distributed in the pipe corridor to prevent the accumulation of gas in local areas, so as to effectively reduce the risk of explosion. 5 Future studies can conduct field experiments in different regions and different types of pipe corridors to collect actual data to validate the simulation model and provide a basis for further optimization of the design. Sensor technology can also be combined with artificial intelligence such as deep learning to develop real-time gas concentration monitoring and explosion risk warning systems to improve the safety of pipe corridors.

https://www.wrightsoft.com/,Home - Wrightsoft,No description,"World leader in HVAC design software Wrightsoft revolutionized the way HVAC systems are calculated by removing the need for inaccurate, labor-intensive manual calculations. Since then, weve been developing more tools to help optimize layouts and air distribution, to boost your revenue through sales and cost tools, and have evolved into the worlds of both 3D and Geothermal design. Design Accurate  Efficient HVAC Systems The all-in-one HVAC software calculates loads for accurate size and system design to maximize comfort and efficiency in performance and installation. Reinventing the way you do business, from plans to permits. Featuring an easy-to-use, intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Elevate your HVAC business with Wrightsofts comprehensive desktop and mobile solutions. From start to finish, our tools empower your operations, whether youre an industry expert or a computer novice. Offering impressive technological solutions designed to adapt with the industry and separate your business from the competition. As a business owner, one of the things I like is that Right-Draw gives us a level of professionalism whether its a specialty home or a basic starter home. Within the past year, we have actually picked up new accounts because our customers were so impressed by the professionalism of our designs, particularly when we go up against contractors who are giving them what amounts to a crayon rendition on a napkin. Ive always been a proponent of proper sizing of air conditioning equipment. For a standard 3,000 square foot, 4 bedroom house, doing the load calculations manually would take many hours. Then I found Wrightsoft, and by using their Right-J and Right-D, I was able to produce load calculations and duct design in about an hour. Hands down, the best tool for the job. Our HVAC partners love the 2-line mode drawings, and the export to REMRate module saves me at least 2 hours per project! Thats a real game changer for us in terms of billable hours and revenue. Mike sales and Donald tech support have been there for us for over 10 years! Keep up the good work and thanks again guys. - Just another loyal happy customer. We are primarily a residential replacement air conditioning and heating company in Clearwater, Florida. We found a serious issue with improperly sized air conditioning systems in existing homes that was causing issues with humidity, or lack of cooling. We have used Manual J for over 30 years, but due to the time-consuming process of entering information manually, it was not done unless we had a consumer complaint. We partnered with Wrightsoft over 15 years ago and can now do a Manual J Load Calculation in less than 30 minutes. Wrightsoft is always there for us, with tech support staff that answers the phone quickly, and offer advice when needed. There is also a library of how to videos available 24 hours a day on their website. Wrightsoft has continued to be the best option for us for Manual J load calculations. I reached out to technical support to complete an advanced task. Technical support responded within an hour or two, guided me through the process, and even QCd my spreadsheet making corrections needed. I was really impressed Ive found that my questions are always answered, usually within hours, and theres never an attempt to dodge an issue. Wrightsofts responsiveness on the support side is what truly sets you apart. Your team has made my life easier and using RSU has become an integral cornerstone to the work I do guiding our teams in the design and construction of high performance, soon to be ZNE affordable housing. Ive been using Wrightsoft since the late 80s. Public Service Company in Oklahomas Good Cents program required an ACCA Manual J load calculation and ACCA Manual D duct design to qualify as a Good Cents structure. As long as the information is entered correctly, Wrightsoft takes all of the guesswork out of the equation. It has given me peace of mind and keeps our quality of installation above the rest. I cant imagine doing an install without it, its as important to us as the rest of the tools on our trucks. The Wrightsoft experience has been great from the beginning to end. Their support staff are patient and professional. Proper equipment sizing is imperative regarding our customers comfort. We have been able to provide our customers with accurate professional data to backup our proposals awarding us multiple projects over our competitors. Well worth the investment of time and money. If youre a Wrightsoft user and have been wanting to go to the next level, Right-CAD is it. Im not conversant with CAD but I was up and running with 3D almost immediately, importing some of my more complex duct designs already created with RSU, and amazed at seeing what I could only imagine before. The 3rd dimension takes the guesswork out of interstitial duct runs, navigating dropped ceiling areas, dropped girders, etc. Learning curve is simplified by utilizing the familiar tools  tabs already within RSU, and yet with lots of bells and whistles for rainy day exploration and further fine tuning of design presentation. I see this as the future of professional  field ready HVAC design, without the cost and lengthy learning curve of Revit. Copyright  2025 MiTek Inc. All rights reserved. Copyright  2025 MiTek Inc.

https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/wet-bulb,Wet Bulb Calculator,"With humidity and temperature you can find out the value of the wet-bulb temperature, and if its any different from the normal air temperature.","Based on1 source Table of contents With many countries reported their highest ever temperatures, such asCanadareaching 49.6 C, its important that you understand the different factors affecting heat and the bodys ability to regulate it. What many people might fail to take into account is the combined result of the heat and humidity - thewet bulb effect. This tool will teach you about the wet bulb, and lets you estimate its scale. The wet bulb calculator operates on a simple principle. You can use it to work out the wet bulb temperature from just two numbers temperature and relative humidity. Keep reading if you want to discover some wet-bulb applications, what the military benefits of the Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature are, and what it has to do with our health -especially within the context of our scorching summers! Despite what you might think at first, wet-bulb temperature has nothing to do with light bulbs. It is instead the temperature read by a special thermometer that is wrapped in water-soaked fabric and ventilated. This thermometer is part of a device called a psychrometer. It includes a dry-bulb thermometer, a wet-bulb thermometer and a psychrometric chart - a graph that plots the relationships between the dry and wet-bulb temperature, relative humidity, and dew point at constant pressure. By definition, wet-bulb temperature isthe lowest temperature a portion of air can acquire by evaporative cooling only. When air is at its maximum 100  humidity, the wet-bulb temperature is equal to the normal air temperature dry-bulb temperature. As the humidity decreases, the wet-bulb temperature becomes lower than the normal air temperature. Data about the wet-bulb temperature is essential when it comes to preventing our body from overheating. Our bodies sweat to cool off, but, because water evaporates slower in more humid conditions, we cool down a lot slower in humid conditions. This causes our internal body temperature to rise. If the wet-bulb temperature exceeds35 C 95 Ffor an extended period of time then people in the surrounding area are at risk ofhyperthermia. Although many equations have been created over the years our calculator uses the Stull formula, which is accurate for relative humidities between 5 and 99 and temperatures between -20C and 50C. It loses its accuracy in situations where both moisture and heat are low in value, but even then the error range is only between -1C to 0.65C. The wet-bulb calculator is based on the following formula It might look intimidating, but dont worry  we do all the calculations for you. Just input two numbers Tfootnotesize TT Temperature  air temperature or dry-bulb temperature is the temperature given by a thermometer not exposed to direct sunlight. RHfootnotesize RH RH Relative humidity  a ratio of how much water vapor is in the air to how much it could contain at a given temperature. Sometimes, the humidity is so high you feel like you could make use of thedensity calculator. Remember that both temperature and wet bulb temperature in this formula are expressed in C! If you would like to use other units, you need to convert them to the Celsius scale before you start calculations. The wet-bulb temperature might not be a widely known measure, but it has some valuable functions Construction- different materials react differently to different humidities, so this temperature is needed when designing a building in different climates. Snowmaking- snow production needs low temperatures and when the humidity decreases the temperature rises. Meteorology- forecasters use wet-bulb temperature to predict rain, snow, or freezing rain. You may find useful here Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature is a kind of an apparent temperature - the temperature perceived by humans - used to estimate the effect of temperature, humidity, wind speed, and sunlight on humans. Athletes, industrial hygienists and the military use it to prevent heat stroke by following guidelines for physical activity and water intake. Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature is determined by the following equation whereTgfootnotesize T_mathrm gTg- the globe thermometer temperature - is measured by a thermometer situated in a black globe. It allows for the estimation of direct solar radiation. Measured indoors, without direct solar radiationsunlight, the Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature uses a shortened formula Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature gives us vital information if we want to be safe on warmer days. Awet bulb is a thermometerin which the bulb is wrapped in a wet cloth. It can be used tomeasure the lowest temperature to which air can be cooledby evaporating water at constant pressure. Basically, it is ametaphor for human sweatand it will tell you how thehuman body would feel in direct sunlight. Quite comfortable wet-bulb temperature is around70 F 22 C, but no more than86 F 30 C. Above this temperature, physical labor becomes impossible. Thehigher the wet-bulb temperature, thehigher the risk of severe heat stress. No. BothWet-Bulb Globe TemperatureWBGT andHeat Indexmeasure thehuman bodys ability to resist stress from heat. What they have in common is thatthey both take into account temperature and relative humidity. The fundamental difference is thatWBGT is calculated with temperature measured in the sun, whileHeat Index is calculated in the shade. Also, WGBT takes into account more parameters. 16.384 C.

In contrast, thewet-bulb temperatureis the degree to which air can be cooled due to the evaporation of water. It is measured by a thermometer wrapped in a water-soaked cloth. Thewet-bulb temperature is always lowerthan the dry-bulb temperature. The combination of the dry-bulb temperature and the wet-bulb temperature gives thestate of the humid air.

Scr.100025107 The use of graphical language in quantum computing for the representation of algorithms, although intuitive, is not very useful for different tasks such as the description of quantum circuits in text environments, the calculation of quantum states or the optimization of quantum circuits. While classical circuits can be represented either by circuit graphs or by Boolean expressions, quantum circuits have until now predominantly been illustrated as circuit graphs because no formal language for quantum circuits that allows algebraic manipulations has so far been accepted. This work proposes a means to represent quantum circuits in a convenient and concise manner, similar to the way Boolean expressions are used in classical circuits. The proposed notation allows the consistent and parameterized description of quantum algorithms, as well as the easy handling of the elements that compose it to achieve powerful optimizations in the number of gates of the circuits. To visualize it, a software implementation of an algebraic quantum circuit framework has been made, which allows describing quantum circuits, as well as their respective state vectors, using the proposed algebraic language. Piotr Ogonowski and Piotr Skindzier 2025Phys. Scr.100015018 Alena Tensor is a recently discovered class of energy-momentum tensors that provides mathematical framework in which, as demonstrated in previous publications, the description of a physical system in curved spacetime and its description in flat spacetime with fields are equivalent. The description of a system with electromagnetic field based on Alena Tensor can be used to reconcile physical descriptions. 1 In curvilinear description, Einstein Field equations were obtained with Cosmological Constant related to the invariant of the electromagnetic field tensor, which can be interpreted as negative pressure of vacuum, filled with electromagnetic field. 2 In classical description for flat spacetime, three densities of four-forces were obtained electromagnetic, against gravity counteraction to gravitational free-fall, and the force responsible for the Abraham-Lorentz effect radiation reaction force. Obtained connection of Einstein tensor with gravity and radiation reaction force, after transition to curvilinear description, excludes black hole singularities. There was obtained Lagrangian density and generalized canonical four-momentum, containing electromagnetic four-potential and a term responsible for the other two forces. In this description charged particles cannot remain at complete rest and should have spin, their energy results from the existence of energy of magnetic moment and the density of this energy is part of the Poynting four-vector. The distribution of charged matter was expressed as polarization-magnetization stress-energy tensor, what may explain why gravity is invisible in QED. 3 In quantum picture, QED Lagrangian density simplification was obtained, and the Dirac, Schrödinger and KleinGordon equations may be considered as approximations of the obtained quantum solution. Farther use of Alena Tensor in unification applications was also discussed. Howard N Southgate 2025Phys. Scr.100015261 New ordinary differential equations ODEs for the evolution of spectral components are derived from the complex GinzburgLandau equation CGLe for one-dimensional spatial domains without boundaries free evolution and with one fixed boundary semi-free evolution. For such evolution, a complex or imaginary diffusion term creates a tendency for waves to lengthen. This requires a novel ansatz and auxiliary condition that treat wavenumbers as time-varying. The ansatz consists of a discrete spatial Fourier transform modified with a time-dependent wavenumber for the peak spectral component. The wavenumbers of the other components are fixed relative to this wavenumber. The new auxiliary condition is the terminal condition for complex diffusion after wavenumbers evolve to zero, they remain at zero. The derived free and semi-free ODEs are solved along characteristic lines located symmetrically about a fixed spatial point. Waves lengthen with time away from this point in both directions. Laboratory experiments on the formation of channel sandbars, theoretically described by the CGLe, show two regions whose evolutionary behaviour is qualitatively predicted by the free and semi-free evolution equations. This analysis applies to other time-dependent partial differential equations with complex or imaginary diffusion terms. New freely evolving solutions are derived for the complex heat equation and Schrödinger equation linear and nonlinear. S B Dugdale 2016Phys.

In the PGTC, the air bottoming cycle is operated by exhaust gases from the topping gas turbine cycle by exchanging heat in the heat exchangers H.E.s by controlling the path of exhaust gases and compressed air through the bypass control valves. The bypass valve in the topping, as well as the bottoming cycle, direct the combustible product from the combustion chamber to the H.E., in such a way that it optimizes the performance of the proposed combined cycle as compared to SGTC. The results show that the maximum increase in Work net output and thermal efficiency in PGTC compared to SGTC is 65.7 atrp 4 and turbine inlet temperature TIT  1500 K, whereas the exergy loss by the exhaust gases in the PGTC is much less than the exergy loss by the exhaust gases in the SGTC. The maximum difference in the exergy loss by the exhaust gases in PGTC and SGTC is also observed atrp 4 and TIT  1500 K. Jack Smith 2022Phys. Scr.97122001 First conceptualised in Olaf Stapledons 1937 novel Star Maker, before being popularised by Freeman Dyson in the 1960s, Dyson Spheres are structures which surround a civilisations sun to collect all the energy being radiated. This article presents a discussion of the features of such a feat of engineering, reviews the viability, scale and likely design of a Dyson structure, and analyses details about each stage of its construction and operation. It is found that a Dyson Swarm, a large array of individual satellites orbiting another celestial body, is the ideal design for such a structure as opposed to the solid sun-surrounding structure which is typically associated with the Dyson Sphere. In our solar system, such a structure based around Mars would be able to generate the Earths 2019 global power consumption of 18.35 TW within fifty years once its construction has begun, which itself could start by 2040 using biennial launch windows. Alongside a 4.17 km2ground-based heliostat array, the swarm of over 5.5 billion satellites would be constructed on the surface of Mars before being launched by electromagnetic accelerators into a Martian orbit. Efficiency of the Dyson Swarm ranges from 0.742.77 of the Suns 3.851026W output, with large potential for growth as both current technologies improve, and future concepts are brought to reality in the time before and during the swarms construction. Not only would a Dyson Swarm provide a near-infinite, renewable power source for Earth, it would also allow for significant expansions in human space exploration and for our civilisation as a whole.

Scr.100012005 Within a decade, the power congversion efficiency PCEs of metal-halide perovskite solar cells PSCs moves upward from 3.9 to 25.7, making them competitive with current state-of-the-art silicon-based counterparts. This steepest growth of the PCEs suggests that the commercialization of this technology might be easing the energy transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy. However, a wide range of factors restrict the commercial viability of PSCs like their toxicity and instability. A crucial and difficult task in the field of PSCs is the replacement of Pb-based perovskite with non-toxic and eco-friendly material while maintaining high-performance with improved stability. Cs2AgBiBr6halide double perovskites HDP material seems to be very promising in this regard. This article reviews the recent progress in Cs2AgBiBr6double PSC devices, especially fabrication techniques including the advancement of its efficiency and stability. Here, the evolution of Cs2AgBiBr6towards the application and fabrication of PSCs has also been discussed. This study also analyzed the impact of numerous environmental stresses, such as mechanical, thermal, and optical stresses including the potential prospects in the case of Pb-free PSCs.

Scr.100025506 This work analyzes numerically the propagation of a fundamental vector soliton in presence of a Raman soliton self-polarization shift RSSPS effect driven by the self- and cross-frequency shift that are induced by the stimulated Raman scattering SRS, which is modeled by two coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations in a circular polarization basis. Particularly, the propagation of the fundamental vector soliton, as a sech-squared temporal pulse profile, is also governed by a compensation balance between dispersion and Kerr effect. In this analysis, the numerical approach for solving the propagation problem is studied in detail. Additionally, for a better understanding of the vector soliton dynamics, the pulse propagation governed by linear and nonlinear effects, considering their individual contributions as well as their simultaneous interplay, are studied by spectrograms, which represent the temporal-spectral distribution of the pulse profile. As a result, the fundamental vector soliton, which maintains its temporal envelope over propagation, validates a temporal walk-off along propagation that is consistent with a redshifted spectral evolution at the same time, the polarization evolution is correlated with this pulse dynamics. Jing Wanget al2025Phys. Scr.100015542 We investigate solitons in nonlinear media with oscillatory nonlocal response, which are confined within a rectangular boundary. We find that the profile of soliton exhibits a nearly Gaussian shape regardless of the boundary value, and is located in the center of the rectangle. The profile of nonlinear refractive index, which exhibits a bell-shaped or oscillatory pattern, is strongly related to the value of the boundary and the degree of nonlocality. The normalized amplitude can also influence the profile of nonlinear refractive index. The stability of the soliton depends on its location within the domain defined by the function relationship curve of the propagation constant and the boundary, the degree of nonlocality, or the normalized amplitude. We further demonstrate the robustness of soliton propagation by the application of initial transverse velocity on solitons and the incident of solitons deviating from the center of the system, resulting in a snake-shaped propagation and chaoticon-shaped pattern.

Scr.100025305 In this work, we have studied about the configuration of a charged anisotropic strange star in the context of generalized Rastall Gravity. We have discussed the equation of motion for a static type symmetric and spherically space-time using the MIT Bag model. Various physical aspects, like energy density, radial pressure and tangential pressure etc., have been constructed with the help of Krori-Barua metric potentials. We have matched interior and exterior Reissner-Nordström geometry to evaluate the unknown constants of the model. Several necessary physical aspects have been examined like energy density, both radial and tangential pressure components, energy conditions, compactness, surface redshift and stability of strange stars with respect to our proposed model analytically and graphically. All graphical analyses are governed for a particular compact star 4U1820  30 and by two coupling parametersαandβ. We have concluded that the effects of extra coupling termRTare minimum than the termRas in the original Rastall Gravity on the physical characteristics of a star. Moreover, all physical aspects satisfied their specific limits, and hence our proposed model is viable and stable. Xinyi Chenet al2025Phys. Scr.100025019 Haze shrouds remote sensing images with a thick veil, severely affecting the extraction of valuable information and posing many obstacles to subsequent high-level vision tasks. However, current methods frequently concentrate solely on spatial information while neglecting frequency domain information. To tackle the above problem, we propose a novel model in this study that combines information from the spatial and frequency domains. Unlike most existing methods, We also investigate the relationship between phase and amplitude spectrum components in the frequency domain and haze degradation and use this connection to design a network structure. We have meticulously designed a central Spatial-frequency block containing a Global frequency supervised block GFS, a Local spatial supervised block LSS, and a Spatial frequency fusion block SFF and utilized parameter-free normalization representation to improve the models capacity to manage instances with varying attributes. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on two remote sensing image dehazing datasets SateHaze1k and RICE-1. The results indicate that our network performs exceptionally well, surpassing previous techniques in both quantitative assessments and visual quality. Our DDSNet demonstrates remarkable effectiveness through quantitative analysis, achieving the highest performance across three subsets of the SateHaze1k dataset, with measured values of 24.0053 dB PSNR and 0.9661 SSIM, 26.6054 dB PSNR and 0.9696 SSIM, and 21.3015 dB PSNR and 0.9208 SSIM.

Calcite CaCO3 and dolomite MgCO3 offer excellent reflection in visible and short-wave infrared bands 0.4 to 2.5 μm, which distinguish them from other rock types and makes them a solid application area for multispectral sentinel-2 sensors. In this study, the monumental deposits of carbonated rocks of the intended study region are mapped and estimated with better accuracy by using a novel Deep Neural Layers-Random Forest merger model and Sentinel-2 imagery. We used ArcGIS 10.5 to prepare a high-quality classified map of the study regions, which can be used further to effectively and efficiently reach out and extract those deposits. The proposed model, trained on a locally generated dataset, containing 134,897 pixels of size 10 m, mapped the deposits with 0.95 accuracy kappa coefficient 0.94, which is 70 of the total mineral deposits of the study regions. The proposed model is the improved version of a prior experimented model consisting of convolution layers and dense layers only, whose accuracy was 0.93. The experimental outcomes of the study stood successful in finding the optimum combination of hyperparameters for the AI models used, to delineate mineralization zones with precision, focusing on carbonate in particular.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS confirms the presence of oxygen vacancies in all monoclinic-phase WO3thin films. A systematic decrease in the band gap was found with an increase in the oxygen vacancies leading to a significant upward shift in the Fermi level. Here, the influence of stoichiometry of WO3thin film on the NO gas sensing performance is presented. It was found that the fabricated device using sub-stoichiometric WO3xshowed enhanced performance in terms of high stability, high selectivity, and fast responserecovery time with a sensor response of 147 for 50 ppm NO concentration at 275 C, with a fast response time 19 s and recovery time 17 s. The NO gas sensing of WO3thin films has been tested at different operating temperatures 175350 C and gas concentrations 150 ppm, witnessing a variation in sensor response. The NO gas sensing mechanism on the surface of WO3has also been discussed. Amal S Aldakhail Allah and Arbab I Arbab 2025Phys. Scr.100025017 A new method for obtaining wave, energy, and momentum conservation equations for Dirac and Maxwell systems is presented. This method makes use of the algebraic features of quaternion products. A framework that uses quaternions to describe quantum physics and electrodynamics has been introduced. In this approach, mass and charge produce electric and magnetic fields that satisfy Maxwells equations. Quaternionic mass leads to massive electrodynamics based on quantum mechanics concepts. The conservation of energy and momentum is not affected by quaternionic mass. Quaternionic Maxwells equations with quaternionic mass yield intriguing phenomena that can be examined experimentally. These equations generalize the classical Wilczek axion electrodynamics to quantum one. Open all abstracts, in this tab Arslan Mehmoodet al2025Phys. Scr.100012001 The widespread application of synthetic dyes across industries poses significant environmental problems, particularly concerning with degradation of water quality. Concerning the possible solutions, copper oxide CuO considered as a feasible candidate. CuO a p-type heterogeneous semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.22.71 eV, It is a reasonable choice and widely studied photocatalyst for addressing such challenges. The functionality of CuO deteriorated, when the wavelength exceeded the UVvisible region. In this manner difficulties associated with reproducibility and reusability, as well as rapid electronhole recombination, prevent the widespread application of this technology. In an attempt to eliminate this defect, researchers have been investigating strategies to activate CuO under visible light, with one promising approach being carbon nanomaterials such as graphene to form carbon-CuO composites. The unique properties of graphene, i.e., its higher surface area and excellent electron mobility, make it a remarkable candidate for the enhancement of CuO photoactivity. This study highlighted the recent progress in the synthesis of graphene-based CuO photocatalysts, with the main characteristic of extending the light absorption capacity of CuO into the visible spectrum. It reveals achievements in material innovations and applications, with a focus on photocatalytic. It has been observed from the documented studies, catalysis is considered as next generation emerging field for the researcher. Md Jakir Hossenet al2025Phys.

The performance of these materials and devices is assessed using a quantitative measure known as the figure of merit, which relies on the Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity of the material. Different classes of thermoelectric materials have their own merits and demerits. High temperature thermoelectric materials are useful for space exploration, automobile applications, etc Many materials have been explored within temperature range of 300900 K, showing suitable properties for thermoelectric applications. Germanium, an inorganic material is investigated in details, due to its high Seebeck coefficient and better thermal stability. Silicon-Germanium alloys are thermoelectric materials suitable for operating at high temperatures. These materials help in reduction of emission of green house gases.

Scr.100012002 With a dimension of roughly 10 nm, carbon quantum dots CQDs are an intriguing family of carbon nanoparticles. Various fabrication techniques, such as ultrasonication, electrochemical oxidation, hydrothermal reaction, laser ablation, microwave irradiation and reflux lead to CQD synthesis through processes including pyrolysis, carbonization, oxidation and polymerization. Sustainable raw materials are often utilized, aligning with environmental concerns and waste reduction efforts. CQDs exhibit low toxicity, chemical inertness, remarkable biocompatibility and highly adjustable photoluminescence behaviour owing to their semiconductor-like properties and oxygen based functional groups. Their tiny particle sizes contribute to highly photoluminescent emissions and controllable fluorescence. In biomedical applications, CQDs show promise for imaging, drug delivery and sensing due to their biocompatibility and tunable optical properties. In environmental contexts, they hold potential for wastewater treatment, heavy metal detection and ion sensing leveraging their adsorption capabilities and photoluminescence. This review explores the synthesis methods, physical and chemical characteristics and diverse applications of CQDs particularly focusing on their potential in biomedical imaging, environmental remediation and sensing technologies.

Core-shell quantum dots were synthesized by colloidal method and hydrophilized by mercaptopropionic acid MPA. To reveal the mechanism for luminescence quenching of these nanosensors, we studied spectral characteristics of QDs and VNC and revealed a complex influence of VNC on the luminescence quenching of CdSZnS and Cd0.9Mn0.1SZnS nanoparticles. We performed quantum chemical calculations of the equilibrium geometry and IR spectra of the VNC-MPA system and the bond energies in the CdSZnSMPAVNC system. The luminescence quenching of CdSZnS QDs by vancomycin was shown to linearly depend on its concentration in the 35690 µM range with the determination coefficient R2  0.988. The luminescence quenching of Cd0.9Mn0.1SZnS QDs was linearly sensitive to vancomycin in the narrower concentration range of 0207 µM with the determination coefficient R2  0.999. The detection thresholds of vancomycin were found to be 56.2 µM and 1.9 µM by CdSZnS QDs and CdSZnS QDs doped with Mn II ions, respectively.xD Khadem et al Image encryption is widely used for securing digital images, with chaos-based schemes among the most promising solutions. Recently, Khalid M. Hosny proposed an image encryption scheme based on a 6D hyperchaotic system and Fibonacci Q-matrix. While this scheme offers notable benefits, it suffers from significant weaknesses, such as improper utilization of initial parameters, weak keys, and flaws in key management, making it vulnerable to attacks. Additionally, it fails to encrypt homogeneous images, after any iteration. This paper proposes an enhanced encryption scheme that addresses these weaknesses. The statistical and simulation test results show that our scheme outperforms the original scheme in terms of security and performance. It passed standard security tests such as image histogram, chi-square distribution, NPCR, UACI, entropy, correlation, and key space analysis for standard images at n  2 iterations. The proposed scheme includes a cryptographic key with low computational cost, a high-resistant S-box to DPA attacks, and improved chaos parameter transfer to provide security. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms similar schemes in both security and bandwidth consumption.xD Zhu et al Flexible opto-optic microwave oscillators OOMO have high potential for providing both optical and electrical signals with high quality. In this work, a scalable OOMO with iterative substructures is proposed and demonstrated. Different from the previous all-optical microwave oscillators, multiple lasers with different wavelengths in an opto-optic oscillation loop serve as a series of optical carriers to support the Vernier effect in the wavelength domain. By performing mutual injection between various laser carriers in a single loop with the semiconductor optical amplifiers SOAs as the modulators, the gain competition between the laser carriers in the SOAs can be prevented, and stable and single-mode oscillation without an ultranarrow bandpass ﬁlter can be realized. We experimentally demonstrate a single-loop OOMO based on the proposed method, and tunable dual-wavelength optical signals for generating microwave signals with low phase noises in a wideband are successfully achieved. The scalable structure of this oscillator is expected to be applicable in the high-quality wavelength division multiplexing applications. Liang et al Low-frequency broadband sound-absorbing structures with smaller thicknesses are the focus of research in noise control. Based on the principle of Helmholtz resonant cavity and the internal spacer chamber division structure, a multilayer snowflake resonator metamaterial MLSRCM is proposed. The MLSRCM model is investigated using theoretical and simulation methods, and it is concluded that the MLSRCM has excellent sound absorption performance in the frequency range of 450-950 Hz with a thickness of only 28 mm. This mainly originated from the parallel connection of multi-units as well as the application of the weak resonance effect of coherent coupling and the full utilization of space. The broadband sound absorption mechanism in MLSRCM is theoretically investigated by analyzing the complex frequency plane. Subsequently, the sound absorption mechanism of the structure is further analyzed in terms of sound velocity and power dissipation density. The results show that the MLSRCM has excellent low-frequency broadband acoustic absorption performance, which provides a reference for the design of new acoustic-absorbing metamaterials with small thicknesses.xD Nuradinov et al The aim of this work is the development of scientifically based ways of influencing the process of nucleation of crystallization centres to control the cast structure and the properties of blanks at the casting stage.

We present an alternative formulation of quantum mechanical angular momentum, based on spatial wavefunctions that depend on the Euler angles φ,θ,χ, and have an additional internal projection n. The wavefunctions are Wigner D-functions, D_n ms φ,θ,χ, for which the body-fixed projection quantum number n has the unusual value nsss1s, or n0. We show that the states D_s ms φ,θ,χ of elementary particles with spin s give a gyromagnetic ratio of g2 for s0, and we identify these as the spatial angular-momentum wavefunctions of known fundamental charged particles with spin. All known Standard-Model particles can be categorized with either value ns or n0, and all known particle reactions are consistent with the conservation of its projection in the internal frame, and with internal-frame Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of unity. Therefore, we make the case that the D_n ms φ,θ,χ are useful as spatial wavefunctions for spin. Some implications and new predictions related to the quantum number n for fundamental particles are discussed, such as the proposed Dirac-fermion nature of the neutrino, the explanation of some Standard-Model structure, and some proposed dark-matter candidates.

The edge localized instabilities in tokamaks equilibria ELITE code an eigenvalue solver is used to calculate the peeling-ballooning P-B instability diagram. It is shown that the reference equilibrium of HL-3 is marginally stable near the peeling boundary. Non-ideal and non-linear simulations are then carried out by 3-field model implemented in BOUT code. For ideal case, the linear results from BOUT modelling agree well with that calculated by ELITE code. Based on BOUT modelling , it is found that diamagnetic drift can significantly stabilize the ELMs. But the effect of the resistivity on ELMs is more complicated, which depends on the transition of the mode structure. Furthermore, non-linear simulations show that the resistivity might trigger the ELMs before the ideal P-B boundary is reached. K Pentlandet al2025Phys. Scr.100025608 A key aspect in the modelling of magnetohydrodynamic MHD equilibria in tokamak devices is having access to fast, accurate, and stable numerical simulation methods. There is an increasing demand for reliable methods that can be used to develop traditional or machine learning-based shape control feedback systems, optimise scenario designs, and integrate with other plasma edge or transport modelling codes. To handle such applications, these codes need to be flexible and, more importantly, they need to have been validated against both analytically known and real-world tokamak equilibria to ensure they are consistent and credible. In this paper, we are interested in solving the static forward GradShafranov GS problem for freeboundary MHD equilibria. Our focus is on the validation of the static forward solver in the Python-based equilibrium codeFreeGSNKEby solving equilibria from magnetics-onlyEFITreconstructions of MAST-U shots. In addition, we also validate FreeGSNKE against equilibria simulated using the well-established MATLAB-based equilibrium codeFiesta. To do this, we develop a computational pipeline that allows one to load the same asymmetric MAST-U machine description into each solver, specify the required inputs activepassive conductor currents, plasma profiles and coefficients, etc. from EFIT, and solve the GS equation for all available time slices across a shot. For a number of different MAST-U shots, we demonstrate that both FreeGSNKE and Fiesta can successfully reproduce various poloidal flux quantities and shape targets e.g. midplane radii, magnetic axes, separatrices, X-points, and strikepoints in agreement with EFITcalculations to a very high degree of accuracy. We also provide public access to the codedata required to load the MAST-U machine description in FreeGSNKEFiesta and reproduce the equilibria in the shots shown. Yan Liuet al2025Phys. Scr. The problem of low-frequency noise is becoming increasingly severe and measuring the sound absorption performance of acoustic metamaterials AMs using accurate absorption coefficients is of great interest in low-frequency noise control engineering. Conventional calculation methods such as Finite Element Method FEM simulations and the theoretical analysis methods TAM have specific limitations. Deep learning DL models provide new perspectives for studying AMs acoustic performance. However, the prediction performance of DL models is highly dependent on the proper tuning of hyperparameters. As far as is known, existing literature has not systematically explored the impact of hyperparameter tuning on DL models in the context of acoustic performance studies. The present paper designed a multi-dimensional Helmholtz resonator MDHR consisting of a 4x4-type continuous parallel arrangement, while a dataset was established via FEM. Furthermore, a deep neural network HPO-DNNs model based on hyperparameter optimization HPO was proposed to predict the acoustic performance of the MDHR. Random search RS, Bayesian optimization BO, Simulated annealing SA, and genetic algorithm GA were introduced to optimize the hyperparameters learning rate, weight decay, optimizer, and batch size of the DNNs. The mean square error MSE, coefficient of determination R2 of the testing dataset and the optimization time were used as the evaluation metrics, GA was selected for further study based on the comparison results MSE0.00177, R20.98151 of the optimization efficiency and predictive precision of DNNs from the four HPO algorithms. Finally, the prediction performance of the GA-DNNs model was evaluated in single-, multi-, and broadband conditions in practical applications, demonstrating high precision and stability and providing a new approach for acoustics performance studies.

The analysis covers radii, orbitals energy, first and second ionization energies, electron affinity, and polarizability. The study confirms that the p12orbitals contract under relativistic effects, whereas for the p32 orbitals, the mass-velocity and spin-orbit effects do not appear to cancel each other out completely. This may indicate that the spin-orbit effect grows, when increasing the atomic number, slightly faster than the mass-velocity effect. In addition, expansion of the np32 orbitals may lead to dilation of the bond length in the related molecules. We found that the non-relativistic Hartree-Fock method gave, for atoms from fluorine to iodine, first ionization energy values with smaller deviations from their experimental ones than other methods involving relativistic and correlation effects. In particular, the method accurately, up to three significative digits, predicts the experimental value for chlorine, and thus can be adopted, discarding other sophisticated methods considering the huge computational effort required by them while not improving much on the agreement with experiment, when evaluating physicalchemical properties of large systems containing light halogen elements. It also predicts an electron affinity of 2.4 eV for the tennessine atom, where it shows also that the relativistic effects play a more important role than in gold atoms.xD Mansoor Sheikh and David Saad 2025Phys.

These typically require a sparse infection signal and use either binary or real-valued entries of O1. However, existing methods do not allow for inferring viral loads which span many orders of magnitude. We develop a message passing algorithm coupled with a PCR Polymerase Chain Reaction specific noise function to allow accurate inference of realistic viral load signals. A version of the Combinatorial Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm is employed to compare the obtained inference results with those of our probabilistic message passing. This work is in the non-adaptive setting and could open the possibility of efficient screening where viral load determination is clinically important.

A truncation method of the basis is also proposed to assure rapid convergence. The computational time and memory involved in the calculations are drastically reduced when compared to previous analysis where the symmetry was taken into account using a different approach.

Magnetic particle imaging MPI is a tracer-based tomographic imaging technique utilized in applications such as lung perfusion imaging, cancer diagnosis, stem cell tracking, etc. The goal of translating MPI to clinical use has prompted studies on further improving the spatial-temporal resolutions of MPI through various methods, including image reconstruction algorithm, scanning trajectory design, magnetic field profile design, and tracer design. Iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles MNPs are favored for MPI and magnetic resonance imaging MRI over other materials due to their high biocompatibility, low cost, and ease of preparation and surface modification. For core-shell MNPs, the tracers magnetic core size and non-magnetic coating layer characteristics can significantly affect MPI signals through dynamic magnetization relaxations. Most works to date have assumed an ensemble of MNP tracers with identical sizes, ignoring that artificially synthesized MNPs typically follow a log-normal size distribution, which can deviate theoretical results from experimental data. In this work, we first characterize the size distributions of four commercially available iron oxide MNP products and then model the collective magnetic responses of these MNPs for MPI applications. For an ensemble of MNP tracers with size standard deviations of σ, we applied a stochastic Langevin model to study the effect of size distribution on MPI imaging performance. Under an alternating magnetic field AMF, i.e., the excitation field in MPI, we collected the time domain dynamic magnetizations M-t curves, magnetization-field hysteresis loops M-H curves, point-spread functions PSFs, dMdH-H curves, and higher harmonics from these MNP tracers. The intrinsic MPI spatial resolution, which is related to the full width at half maximum FWHM of the PSF profile, along with the higher harmonics, serve as metrics to provide insights into how the size distribution of MNP tracers affects MPI performance. J J Navaet al2025Phys. Scr.100025913 The hexagonalβ-phase of bulk Be3N2is a wide band gap semiconductor with potential ultraviolet UV optoelectronics applications. Here, we have performed the first theoretical study of the electronic and optical properties of theβphase of Be3N2considering many-body effects. In particular, we have obtained the electronic band structure and spectra of the dielectric function, complex refractive index and electron energy loss function. For the calculation of the band structure, both Density Functional Theory and G0W0approximation plus Wannier interpolation of the bands have been applied. For the calculation of the optical spectra, we have employed both the independent particle approach as well as the formalism that incorporates many-body and excitonic effects, by applying G0W0approximation and solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation BSE. The results show, for instance, that the spectrum of the imaginary part of the dielectric function ofβ-Be3N2has an anisotropic behavior. Even more, the material shows its highest absorption peak in the UV range, which makes it interesting due to its possible high-temperature photodetection applications. Also, in the visible energy range of the spectrum, the index of refraction along thez-axis see figure 1 is predicted to be around 1.6, which is a high value for a solid. More Open Access articles"

It would do this primarily by providing incentives for the air sealing and insulating of buildings and the adoption of alternative heating technologies. Act 18 did not implement the CHS but instead required the Public Utility Commission to study the idea and issue a detailed report. Given the current political reality in Vermont, the CHS is not going to move ahead in its present form, but I want to write about how we got here and the implications for future policy. The commission released its report on Jan. 15. It found that the initial cost of the program would be about 8 or 9 cents per gallon of heating fuel, a far cry from the projections from folks who opposed the bill, who predicted the increase in fuel costs to be anywhere from 70 cents to 4 or more per gallon. The reports projection is very much in line with the estimates that proponents of the bill had originally anticipated and much less than was feared by many. In addition, costs are only one part of the equation. Equally important are the benefits. Given these relatively modest costs, the benefits of the program would have likely greatly outweighed them. We would have seen otherwise untapped savings in efficiency, more stable prices for heating, and more money kept in our local economy. The Clean Heat Standard is opposed primarily by two groups. The first is the deep-pocketed fossil fuel industry. This is no surprise, as the proposed law would have accelerated the transition away from their products and cost them some future profits. They did a fine job of scaring Vermonters with wildly exaggerated projections for price increases and is a great example of an industry that successfully puts its interests above that of ordinary people. Id like to note here that there are many local fuel dealers in the state that have started diversifying their businesses on their own and supported the CHS, as they saw it as a way for them to both ease their transition away from fossil fuels and a way to help their customers do so as well. The other group is composed of folks who believe that markets will naturally solve most of our problems and that government action is usually misguided at best, and terribly harmful at worst. Markets can be a powerful tool for allocating scarce resources, but markets that are not properly regulated are prone to abuse. Monopolies that enrich themselves at the expense of everyone else are the most obvious example of this, but there are many others. A core responsibility of our government is to set the rules for how markets behave so that the benefits of our economy are broadly enjoyed and not appropriated by small groups. Unfortunately, recent statistics on income and wealth inequality show that weve been abdicating this responsibility. Life is quite good if youre in the top 10 or so, but much harder as you move down the economic ladder. All markets have rules that govern them. Some are set by private interests and some by the government. A great deal of the power in our society lies in who controls those rules. Article continues after... CrossWord Flipart Typeshift SpellTower Really Bad Chess The energy sector in Vermont is a nice case study in the difference between highly and lightly regulated markets. The electric power companies and their prices are highly regulated oil prices are not. A result of this is that cost increases for power tend to be modest and predictable. Contrast this with oil prices, which can change quickly and dramatically, sometimes with disastrous consequences, especially for families with modest incomes. Of course, not all aspects of our economy need to be tightly regulated. We need to be judicious and recognize that the world is always changing. We must pay attention and be responsive. Governments dont always get policy right. Its not hard to find examples of laws that did exactly the opposite of their intent. This does not mean the governments should shy away from their responsibility to be a strong vehicle for our collective action. In many ways this is what democracy is all about. The big issues we are facing today  housing, health care, education and climate resilience  are not going to solve themselves. We must take collective action, and this will largely mean changes in state policy. We will need to make hard choices, we will need to stand up to narrow interests and fight for the common good, we will need to be creative and brave. We will make mistakes. We always have. We will need to learn from them, do better and move on. That is how we make progress. Rep.

I, a food editor, tried it myself to bring you the following tips for making them at home.","All Topics Genius tips, tricks  beautiful things, straight to your inbox every day.  2010-2021 Wow Media Products, Inc doing business as PureWow. All rights reserved. Im not much of abreakfastperson, but every so often, I wake up craving a stack of fluffy, buttery pancakes. That said, its a rarity that Ill leap out of bed to fire up the griddle usually justlookingat the bag of flour in mypantryis enough to deter me. Thats where this two-ingredient banana pancake recipe comes in. Even the most culinarily challenged among us can pull it off without snags or complications, and itll leave you with a fraction of the dirty dishes to clean, sincebakingingredients and equipment arent needed. Read on for a step-by-step explanation, plus some tips for preparing and serving this unexpectedly tastybreakfasthack. This 2-Ingredient Bagel Recipe Is Impossible to Mess Up and Surprisingly Tasty Theyre an easy pancake substitute made with nothing buteggandbanana, plus a bit of cooking oil to grease the skillet. If youre wondering how this combo doesnt result in a fruity, unappetizing scramble, its because the egg acts as a binder, giving the pancakes structure, while the banana offers sweetness and moisture. This allows for flour and other common ingredients to be taken out of the equation. This banana pancakes recipe is popular with dieters, parents of picky eaters and folks who are allergic to gluten andor dairy. Despite their better-for-you reputation, theyre quite soft, custardy and indulgent in both flavor and texture. Warning They taste banana-y, so if you arent a fan of the flavor, this recipe isnt for you. But if you are, you might be surprised by how much you enjoy this recipe. Full disclosure These arent an uncanny replacement for traditional pancakesbut theyll likely satisfy your hankering for a short stack in a pinch. After all, you can top them with butter and syrupor jam,Nutellaor honeyjust like the real thing. To make them more like the O.G., I suggest addingvanilla extractandcinnamonto the batter, orchocolate chips, granola and berries to each pancake as they cook. For the batter, a touch of baking powder can make them fluffier. I also suggest using very ripe bananas for more sweetness. The ratio of egg to banana is what I consider most important. Generally, you should use one banana for every two eggs, but since bananas vary in size, aim for about ½ a cup. In terms of preparation, flipping is arguably the trickiest part. The batter is runnier than what youre used to, so you need to be patient before turning them over, and there wont be bubbles on top to tell you its time. Waiting for the opportune moment will help keep the banana pancakes intact and allow for proper browning. Gently lift the pancakes on one side to ensure theyre golden on the bottom before turning them. How to Make 3-Ingredient Cookies and Cream Ice Cream"
